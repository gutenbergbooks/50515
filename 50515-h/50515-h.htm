<div class='summary'>
SOME SLIGHT EXPLANATION—OBJECTS OF THE EXPEDITION—LOVE
THE PROMOTER—LUCY THATCHER—HER PORTRAIT
BY LAMPLIGHT
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> idea occurred to me, quite unexpectedly
and unsought for, early one morning in bed;
and, as ideas of such magnitude are valuable and
scarce (at any rate, with me), it was not long before
I determined to try and realize it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The expedition was so successful, and we got,
on the whole, so clear and clean away with the
swag, or, as Mr. Julius C. Brentin, our esteemed
American <span class='it'>collaborateur</span>, called it, “the boodle,”
that, for my part, there I should have been perfectly
content to let the affair rest; but, the fact
is, so many of my friends have taken upon themselves
to doubt whether we really did it at all, and
the Monte Carlo authorities from the very first
so cunningly managed to suppress all details (with
their subsidized press), that I feel it due to us all
to try and write the adventure out; since I know
very well how, with most, seeing in print is believing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Briefly, then, my idea was to sack or raid the
gambling-tables at Monte Carlo, that highly notorious
<span class='it'>cloaca maxima</span> for all the scum of Europe,
which there gutters and gushes forth into
the sapphire and tideless Mediterranean. I had
worked details out for myself, and believed that,
what with the money on the tables and the reserve
in the vaults, there could not be much
short of £200,000 on the Casino premises, a sum
as much worth making a dash for, it seemed to
me, as Spanish plate-ships to Drake or Raleigh.
Nor did it seem likely we should have to do
much fighting to secure it; for all the authorities
I consulted assured me the place was by
no means a Gibraltar, and, in fact, that half a
dozen resolute gentlemen with revolvers and a
swift steam-yacht waiting in the harbor would
be more than enough to do the trick and clean
the place out; which was pretty much what we
found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the morality of the affair, I confess <span class='it'>that</span>
never in the least troubled me—never once. One
puts morality on one side when dealing with a
gaming-establishment, and to raid the place
seemed to me just as reasonable and fair as to
go there with a system, besides being likely to
be a good deal more profitable. And since the
objects to which we destined the money were in
the main charitable, I soon came to regard the
expedition strictly <span class='it'>in pios usus</span> (as lawyers say),
and hope and believe the public will regard it in
that light too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let me say right here—to quote Mr. Brentin
again—that not one of us touched one single red
cent of the large amount we so fortunately secured,
but that it was all expended for the purposes
(in the main, as I say, charitable) for which
we had always intended it—with the single exception
of a necklet of napoleons I had made for
the fat little neck of my enchanting niece Mollie,
which she always wears at parties, and keeps to
this day in an old French plum-box, along with
her beads and bangles and a small holy ring I
once brought her from Rome; being amazingly
fond of all sorts of bedizenments, as most female
children are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mollie, therefore, was the only person who
really had any of the swag, or boodle; though, of
course, she doesn’t know it, and thinks it was
properly won at play. For as for Bob Hines,
who had some for the new gymnasium and swimming-bath
at his boys’ school at Folkestone; and
Mr. Thatcher (my dear wife Lucy’s father), who
got his old family estate, Wharton Park, back;
and the hospitals, convalescent homes, and sanatoriums,
which all shared alike; and Teddy Parsons,
of my militia, who had the bill paid off that
was worrying him—that was all in the original
scheme, and all went to form the well-understood
reasons for our undertaking the expedition; without
which inducements, indeed, it would never
even have started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So if, after this clear denial in print, the public
still choose to fancy anything has stuck to
my fingers, all I can ask them in fairness to
do is to come to our flat in Victoria Street any
morning between twelve and two, when they can
see the accounts and receipts for themselves, all
in order and properly audited by Messrs. Fitch
&amp; Black, the eminent accountants of Lothbury,
E. C....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, they say love is at the bottom of most
of the affairs and enterprises of the world, and
so I believe it mostly is. At all events, I don’t
fancy I should have undertaken, or, at any rate,
been so prominent in this Monte Carlo affair,
if I hadn’t at the time been so deeply in love
with Lucy, and correspondingly anxious to get
her father’s property back for them at Wharton
Park. It is situate near Nesshaven, on the
Essex coast; which, though to many it may
not be a particularly attractive part of the country,
is to me forever sacred as the spot where I
first met the dear girl who is now my wife,
coming back so rosily from her morning bath,
through the whin and the sand, from the long,
flat shore and the idle sea, carrying her own
damp towel back to her father’s inn, “The
French Horn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I can see her now as I saw her then, on that
warm September morning eighteen months ago;
sea and sky and monotonous Essex land all
bathed in hazy sunshine, the whins still glistening
with the morning mist, which at that time
of the year lies heavily till the sun at mid-day
warms them dry and sets the seed-cases exploding
like Prince-Rupert drops—I can see her, I
say, come towards me along the coast-guard
path, round the pole that sticks up to mark it,
and towards the wooden bridge that crosses one
of the dikes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any line of that sweet face were faint in my
memory, I have only to look across at her now,
as she sits sewing under the lamp as I write,
for all its charm and perfection to be present as
first I saw it. I have only to put a straw-hat on
the pretty, rough, dark hair, which in sunshine
gleams with the bronze of chestnut, give her a
freckle or two on the low, white forehead, color
her round cheek a little more delicately rose-leaf,
and there she is—not forgetting to take away the
wedding-ring!—as she passed me on the Nesshaven
golf-links that hazy September morning
eighteen months ago. There is the straight nose,
the short upper lip, the pure, fresh mouth, the
plump and rounded chin, and the soft, pink lips
that part so readily with a smile and show the
beautiful white teeth, white as the youngest
hazel-nuts....</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy felt my eyes were upon her, and looked
up at me and smiled, with something of a blush,
for she blushes very readily. She saw me still
looking longingly, the invitation in my eyes, and
after a moment’s hesitation (for, though we have
been married nearly six months, she still is shy)
she put down her sewing and came to me at my
writing-table. She bent over me and put her
arms round my neck, her warm cheek against
mine. Her soft lips kissed me; I felt the tender,
loving palpitation of her bosom as I bent
my head back. Our sitting-room seemed full of
silence, happy and melodious silence, while from
outside in Victoria Street I head the jingle of a
passing cab....</p>

<div class='summary'>
“THE FRENCH HORN”—MABEL HARKER, MY UNFORTUNATE
ENGAGEMENT TO HER—MR. CRAGE AND WHARTON
PARK
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Though</span> the idea to sack Monte Carlo did not
occur to me till late in the year (in the September
of which I first met Lucy Thatcher), I must first
say something of my going down to Nesshaven
in June, and the events which led to my being in
a position to undertake an affair of such nerve
and magnitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy thought I should take readers straight to
Monte Carlo, confining myself to that part of the
work only; but, after talking it over, she agrees
with me now that the adventure must be led up
to in the natural way it really was or the public
won’t believe in it, after all, and I shall have all
my pains for nothing. So that’s what I shall do,
in the shortest and best way I can; promising,
like the esteemed old circus-rider Ducrow, as
soon as possible to “cut the cackle and come to
the ’osses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then, it was towards the middle of June
when I joined the golf club at Nesshaven, just after
my militia training month was over. I was
introduced by Harold Forsyth (one of our Monte
Carlo band later, and one of the stanchest of
them), who had the golf fever very badly, and, I
must say, was beginning to make himself rather
a bore with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and I went down from Liverpool Street
and stayed at “The French Horn,” the inn kept
by Mr. Thatcher, Lucy’s father; and after Forsyth
had introduced me to the club and shown
me round the links, he went back to his regiment,
the “Devon Borderers,” then stationed at
Colchester, very angry and complaining, as soldiers
mostly are when obliged to do any work.
I remained behind, not that I had yet seen Lucy,
but rather to keep out of Mabel Harker’s way—the
young lady to whom (as Lucy knows) I happened,
much against my will, to be at that time
unfortunately engaged to be married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first visit to “The French Horn” lasted
three weeks, during which time I manfully held
my ground, though heavily bombarded by Mabel’s
letters, regularly discharged thrice a week from
her aunt’s house in Clifton Gardens at Folkestone.
At last, as Mabel came to stay at her sister’s in
the Regent’s Park (on purpose, I believe), I was
obliged to go up to town for ten days, and there
passed a sad time with her at the University
match, Henley, and the Eton and Harrow; at
which noted places of amusement and relaxation
I cannot help thinking I was the most unhappy
visitor, though, to be sure, I tried hard not to
show it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was dreadful when I got back to my
rooms in Little St. James’s Street and attempted
sleep; for I really think that <span class='it'>not</span> being in love
with the person you have bound yourself to marry
keeps more men awake <span class='it'>more miserably</span> than
any of the so-called torments of love, which, with
scarcely an exception, I have never found otherwise
than agreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last Mabel went back to Folkestone, and I
was free to return to “The French Horn,” and I
never saw her again (thank goodness!) till the
momentous interview between us in October,
from which I emerged a free man; she having
discovered in a boarding-house at Lucerne an
architect named Byles, whom she’d the sense to
see was a more determined wooer than I had ever
been, and likely to make her a far better husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The French Horn” is not an old house, having
been built in about the year 1830, from designs
made by Mr. Thatcher’s father, who had
copied it from an inn he had once stayed in in
Spain. For a country gentleman of old family,
the father seems to have been a somewhat remarkable
person. He had, for instance, been an
intimate friend of the celebrated Lord Byron,
and was the only man in England (so Mr. Thatcher
always said) who knew the real story of the
quarrel between the poet and his wife. Byron
confided it to him at Pisa as the closest of secrets;
but, as he had always told it to everybody
when alive, and his son, my father-in-law, invariably
did and still does the same, there must be
a good many people in England by now who know
all about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, there was scarcely a golfer or bicyclist
came to the house but Mr. Thatcher didn’t fix him
sooner or later in the bar and ask him if he knew
the real reason why Byron quarrelled with his
wife and left England. And as it was a hundred
to one chance that they didn’t, Mr. Thatcher
always informed them in a loud, husky whisper,
and shouted after them as they left, “But you
mustn’t publish it, because it’s a family secret!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the reason was, according to Mr. Thatcher,
that Lord Byron had killed a country girl when
a young man (somebody he’d got into trouble, I
suppose) and flung her body in the pond at Newstead;
and that having, in a moment of loving
expansion, bragged of it to his wife, Lady Byron
had, very properly, promptly kicked him out of
the house in Piccadilly; which, also according
to Mr. Thatcher, was the origin of those touching
lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“They tell me ’tis decided you depart:</p>
<p class='line0'>’Tis wise, ’tis well, but not the less a pain,”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>invariably quoted by him on the departure of a
guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was this same father of Mr. Thatcher’s who
had parted with Wharton Park, their ancestral
home. He had been a great gambler in his
youth, and lost enormous sums at Crockford’s
and on the turf, so that when he died, in 1850,
he had nothing to leave his only son, my Lucy’s
father, but three or four thousand pounds, very
soon muddled away in unfortunate business
speculations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, about twenty years ago, it occurred to
Mr. Thatcher to come down to Nesshaven and
take “The French Horn,” close to the Park gates
of his old home, where, until the golf mania set
in, beyond gaining a bare livelihood, he did no
particular good; having to depend on natural-history
lunatics, who came there in winter and
prowled the shore with shot-guns after rare birds,
and, in summer, on families from Colchester—tradespeople
and bank-clerks and so on—who
spent their holidays lying about in the warm
sand among the whins and complaining of the
food. Betweenwhiles there was scarcely a soul
about except the coast-guards, who came up to
fill their whiskey-bottles, and a few bicyclists
who ate enormous teas and never would pay more
than ninepence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when a Colchester builder erected the
club-house down on the links, Mr. Thatcher’s
business looked up wonderfully, and he really
began to make money, and even sometimes to
turn it away, for the house was small. Harold
Forsyth discovered it, being quartered so near,
and it was he who introduced me, for which I
can never be sufficiently grateful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a curious place, as most amateur buildings
are. Forsyth had not told me anything
about it, and I was indeed astonished when we
first drove up; for, with its colored bricks, veranda,
high-pitched roof, and odd carved wood-work,
it reminded me somehow of an illustration to
<span class='it'>Don Quixote</span>, and I quite expected to see a team
of belled mules and hear the gay castanet click
of the fandango. Instead of which, out came
Mr. Thatcher in a dirty old cricket blazer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was towards the middle of June, and the
sun was just setting at the end of a long, warm
day. Mr. Thatcher showed us our rooms, and
then took us into the great hall up-stairs, from
which a balcony and steps descended into the
garden. It had a very high-pitched roof, and
was decorated in the Moorish fashion (rather like
the old London Crystal Palace; where, by-the-way,
I have eaten pop-corn many a time as a boy,
but cannot honestly say I ever enjoyed it), and
would hold, I dare say, a hundred and fifty people;
rather senseless, I thought, seeing there
were only seven or eight bedrooms, but possibly
useful for bean-feasts or a printer’s wayz-goose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The broad June sun was setting, as I say, and
streamed right in from the garden, as Forsyth
and I ate our dinner. The only other guests
were two brothers named Walton, who spent
their lives playing golf. They played at Nesshaven
all day, and wrote accounts of it every
night, sitting close together, smoking and mumbling
about the condition of the greens and their
tee-shots, all of which was solemnly committed
to paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What they would have done with themselves
twenty years ago I can’t conceive—possibly taken
to drink. At any rate, now they only live for
golf, and their thick legs and indifferent play are
to be seen wherever there’s a links and they can
get permission to perform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thatcher’s wife, a doctor’s daughter, had
long been dead; but his old mother, of the astonishing
age of ninety-three, was still alive, and
lived with him in the inn. At first she had not
at all liked the idea of settling down almost at
the gates of Wharton Park, her old home; but
every year since they came she had expected
would be her last, and she only lived on on sufferance,
as it were, in the hope she would soon
die. Sprier old lady, however, I must say, I never
saw. She wasn’t in the least deaf, and never
wore glasses, and she was simply the keenest
hand at bezique I ever encountered; at which
entertaining game, by-the-way, if she wasn’t
watched, she would cheat outrageously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She came of a good old Norfolk family, and
actually remembered the jubilee of George III.
in 1810; but when asked for details of that
touching and patriotic event, all she could say
was, “Well, I remember the blacksmith’s children
dressed in white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Mrs. Thatcher and I were great friends,
and used to potter about the garden together in
the early mornings. Farther abroad she never
ventured, except once a year, I believe, when she
trotted off to the church to visit her husband’s
grave and see the tablet inside was kept clean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So June and part of July slipped away, diversified,
as I have explained, by a visit to London
and some melancholy pleasures sipped in Mabel
Harker’s society, from which I returned to
“The French Horn” in a truly desperate and
pitiable frame of mind. Indeed, so low and forlorn
was I at times that Mr. Thatcher, with great
sympathy, once or twice fetched me out a bottle
of old port (and not bad tipple, either, for a country
inn), which we drank together, while he related
to me at some length the misfortunes of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chief among them was the loss of his ancestral
home, Wharton Park. The Thatchers
had lived there since the first of them, a Lord
Mayor of the time of Henry VIII., had built
the house in the year 1543—of which original
structure only the stables, in an extremely
ramshackle condition, remained. A drunken
Thatcher with a bedroom candle had burned
the rest, towards the end of the last century,
when the present house was built by my father-in-law’s
grandfather; a bad man, apparently,
since though he had a wife and children established
in Portman Square, he kept a mistress in
one of the wings of Wharton Park, where one
night she went suddenly raving mad (treading on
her long boa and believing it a serpent come
from the lower regions to claim and devour her),
and filled the air with her screechings till, a year
later, she died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thatcher’s father had mortgaged the place
heavily to Mr. Crage, an attorney and moneylender
of Clement’s Inn, and soon after his death,
in 1850, the mortgage was foreclosed, and Mr.
Crage took possession and had lived there with
great disrepute ever since. He was a very vile
old man, who had killed his wife with ill-treatment
and turned his daughters out-of-doors; no
female domestic servant was safe from his dreadful
advances, and at last he was left with no one
to serve him but the gardener and his wife, with
whom, especially when they all got drunk together
on gin-and-water in the kitchen, he was as often
as not engaged in hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I first saw him he was well over eighty,
and a more abandoned-looking old villain I never
set eyes on; with a gashed, slobbering mouth, in
which the yellow teeth stuck up out of the under-jaw
like an old hound’s; a broken nose, which
had once been hooked, until displaced by a young
carpenter in the village, whose sweetheart he had
been rude to; and the most extraordinary, bushy,
black eyebrows. His hand shook so he always cut
himself shaving, and his chin was always dabbled
with dry blood. In short, a more malignant and
gaunt personality I never saw, as I first did quite
close, leaning on a gate and mumbling to himself,
dressed in a tight body-coat, gaiters, and a
dull, square, black hat, like a horse-coper’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember he called out to me over the gate
in a rasping voice, “Hi, there, you young Cockney!
what’s the time?” Whereupon I haughtily
replied it was time he thought of his latter end
and behaved himself. At which he fell to cursing
and shaking his stick, and making sham, impotent
efforts to get over the gate. For they told
me he was mortally afraid of dying, as all bad
(and, for the matter of that, many good) men are.
He knew, of course, Mr. Thatcher was the rightful
owner of the place, and he would sometimes
come down to “The French Horn” and jeer him
about it, offering it for £30,000, which, he dared
say, Mr. Thatcher had in the house. And more
than once, curse his senile impudence! Mr.
Thatcher told me he had offered to marry Lucy!—but
this is really too horrible a subject to be
dwelt on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, I loathed the old wretch so heartily
that it was perhaps the happiest moment of my
life (with the exception of that blessed February
morning when I stood at the altar of Nesshaven
church with Lucy and heard her sweet and tremulous
“I will”) when, after our triumphant return
from Monte Carlo, Mr. Thatcher and I went
up to Wharton Park with the £30,000 in notes
and gold and paid the old ruffian out over the
coarse kitchen-table, almost the only furniture
of the grand drawing-room, where there were
still the old yellow silk hangings—as will all
come in its place, later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy Thatcher at this time, in June and July,
was staying with her aunt, Miss Young, her
mother’s sister, who kept a girls’ school in the
Ladbroke Grove Road, out at Notting Hill. She
taught some of the younger children and made
herself generally useful, taking them out walks
in Kensington Gardens; for Mr. Thatcher wisely
thought her too beautiful to be always at “The
French Horn,” since bicyclists and golfers are
somewhat apt to be too boldly attentive to the
lovely faces they meet with on their roundabouts.
Nor can I altogether blame them. So, as I have
said, I never saw her till my return in September,
when her beauty and modesty—which in
my judgment are synonymous—at once captured
me, and always will hold me captive till I die.</p>

I CONTINUE TO KEEP OUT OF MABEL HARKER’S WAY AND
GO TO GORING—RETURN TO “THE FRENCH HORN”—WANDERINGS
WITH LUCY—MR. CRAGE REHEARSES
HIS OWN FUNERAL
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>As</span> August approached I began to feel apprehensive
as to the right course to pursue with regard
to Mabel Harker, my <span class='it'>fiancée</span>. I don’t want
to say anything unkind about her here in print,
but, the fact is, the engagement had been an unfortunate
one from the first. Let me only observe
that I really honestly think if a man is to
choose between behaving like a brute (as people
say you do when you break off an engagement)
and making himself miserable for life (as I most
certainly should if I had married Mabel), he had
much better select the former course. At any
rate, I know now that if I had had the brutality,
or the courage, to tell Mabel point-blank at first
that I was very sorry, but I didn’t care for her
sufficiently to marry her, I should have spared
myself a vast deal of annoyance and self-reproach,
which now I understand to have been
altogether unnecessary; seeing, I know now very
well, she didn’t really care for me in the least,
but simply regarded me as a lay-figure (with
eight hundred a year) to stand beside her at the
altar rails and mechanically say “<span class='it'>I will</span>” and “<span class='it'>I
do</span>” and the rest of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After her visit to her sister’s in the Regent’s
Park, in July, she had gone back to Folkestone,
and I was in some tremor whether she might not
desire me to spend the holiday months with them
there; but, most fortunately, Mrs. Harker, her
aunt, received a very good offer for her house in
Clifton Gardens, which she determined to take,
and go abroad to Switzerland, where she and
Mabel could live in a <span class='it'>pension</span> and save quite
three-fourths of the home rent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mabel wanted me to join them, but I managed
to get out of it, and very lucky I did; for it was
at that very <span class='it'>pension</span> at Lucerne she met Charles
Byles, the architect, her present husband, and a
great ass he must have looked with that small
face of his and huge mustache, and a rope round
him for going up Pilatus; besides being slightly
bandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for me, I went off down to my sister’s,
Mrs. Rivers, married to the publisher, who had
taken a little house on the river at Taplow, where
I spent the end of August and early part of September
with great content, more especially in
the middle of the week, when my precious brother-in-law
(a dull fellow and a prig) was away doing
his publishing in town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I left Taplow the second week in September,
and something gentle, yet persuasive and strong,
seeming to call me back to “The French Horn,”
off I went there; and there, as I have already
mentioned, I met and fell madly in love with
Lucy Thatcher at first sight, a passion deepening
to a tempest before October dawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as I am telling the truth in this work,
and not writing a romance, I have to admit that
the month I had of Lucy’s dear companionship,
before I knew I was free, was by no means spent
idly, and that I made all the running with her
of which my amorous wits are capable, just as
though I had been really unappropriated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was this altogether wrong, for I felt quite
sure Providence would stand my good friend,
as always in such affairs before, and direct Mabel
Harker’s hopes into another, sounder matrimonial
channel than mine. Even if Providence
had not, but had stood aloof and fought shy, I
should then most certainly have deemed it necessary
to play the part myself, seeing how deeply
and truly my heart was now <span class='it'>for the first time</span> engaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dear! dear! at what amazing speed that happy
month flew past; how little there seems I can
say about it now. Isn’t it strange that Time,
whom poets prefigure as an ancient person with
anchylosed joints, further encumbered, notwithstanding
his great age, with a scythe and an enormous
hour-glass, is yet on occasion capable of
showing the panting hurry of a sprinter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Lucy I was alone almost all the time,
for Mr. Thatcher, very properly, wouldn’t allow
her to help in the bar—a department he gracefully
presided over himself in his dirty blazer,
grasping the handle of the beer engine, and sometimes,
on Saturday nights mostly, slightly shaken
with a gentlemanly but unmistakable attack of
hiccoughs. So dear Lucy had nothing much to
do but go bathing and help her grandmother in
the garden, gathering the plums and raking
down the ripening apples. And though there
were days when, womanlike, she shunned me and
kept out of my way (so as not to make herself
too cheap), yet she was very frank and simple
and trusting in giving me at other times her
constant companionship; and as on the days
when she desired to be more alone I always respected
her wish and kept away (just turning at
the fourth hole on the links to watch her light,
firm figure crossing down to her bathing-tent on
the shore, and waving the putter at her), she was,
as she has since told me, pleased at my delicacy
and perception, and showed her pleasure when
we again met by the extraordinary brightness of
her eyes and the sweet readiness of her smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was harvest-time, and though Mr. Thatcher
had no acreage of his own, still there was plenty
of it round him under cultivation, and a fine time
it was for the Tap, for which there was a separate
entrance, with a painted hand pointing to it for
those who couldn’t read. While my sweetheart
and I strolled about the lanes by day, gathering
blackberries and plucking at the wisps of corn
caught by the high hedges and low branches
from the passing wagons, on warm evenings we
would sit alone in the garden, listening to the
hearty rustic revelry of premature harvest-homes
from the inn, and, when it was very still, hearing
the faint, mysterious rustle of the waves on the
long, sandy shore, as though the lulling sea were
whispering to the land, “Hush! hush! now go to
sleep like a good child. You’ve had a long day
and must be tired—<span class='it'>hush!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this time, as I very well remember,
we strolled up late one afternoon to Wharton
Park, her old ancestral home, and a very curious
and unedifying sight we witnessed there. We
went in at the empty lodge gates, and had a look
in first at the church in the Park grounds, of
which Mr. Thatcher kept the key in the bar; for
there was no rectory, and the parson came over
only on Sundays from Nesshaven for an afternoon
service—at six in summer and at three in
winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ancient, bird-haunted edifice was pretty
full of deceased Thatchers—all of them, in fact,
I believe, lie there, except the Lord Mayor of
Henry VIII.’s reign, who gets what rest he can
in a church off Cornhill, and Mr. Thatcher’s
grandfather, who is buried out at Florence; and
where there aren’t tablets and tombs of old-time,
worthy Thatchers, there are kindly memorials to
their servants, house-keepers, and bailiffs for forty
years and so on; which when Lucy and I had
duly and reverently inspected and sighed over,
we had a peep in at the vestry, where hung the
parson’s crisp surplice behind a piece of religious
arras, and a framed and glazed view of Wharton
in 1750 (the mansion that was burned), with pompous
gentlemen in three-cornered hats giving
their hands to ladies in immense hoops up the
centre path; and a tattered, begrimed notice of
the reign of Queen Anne, affording the clergy
instructions for sending parishioners up to St.
James’s to be touched for the king’s evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when we had mourned over these things,
and inspected the fragment of the holy-water
scoop, and the blunt, whitewashed squint, and
the broken place where once the mass-priests sat,
and the Wharton pew, with an icy cold stove in it
and a little frame of dingy red curtain hung
round on rods and rings, so that the hinds
shouldn’t see when the quality Thatchers fell
asleep—not in the Lord!—on drowsy summer
Sunday afternoons—as, alas! they haven’t had
the opportunity of doing for many years past
now; then we went on up to the house, leaving
the drive, however, and dodging across the fields
to the <span class='it'>ha-ha</span>, for fear of meeting that old villain
Crage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We got up through a small spinney to the end
of the ha-ha that faces the house, and, as we were
quite close, saw with our own eyes a most strange
and monstrous sight—a sight so strange that many
readers would scarcely credit it, had they not
noticed that truth and not fiction is my object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hidden in the spinney, we were not more than
forty yards from the house, which is long and low
and not particularly beautiful—in fact, decidedly
Gothic and unsightly. In front of it, lengthways
and pretty broad, runs a gravel path, and up and
down that broad gravel path was stamping and
swearing old Mr. Crage; stamping and swearing
and shaking his stick at six men (laborers of his,
Lucy said, and all men she knew) who were actually
carrying a coffin, a smart, brand-new coffin
with dandy silver handles, on their shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old wretch was positively rehearsing his
own funeral! We could very plainly hear him
cursing the men for walking too fast and jolting
him, and so on; as though, once the miserable
old hunks were cold, it mattered how anybody
carried him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he made them rest the coffin on one end
while he showed them himself the pace they
should travel and the demeanor they ought to exhibit;
and truly, if it hadn’t been scandalous and
horrible it would have been ludicrous to see the
way the blaspheming old scamp trailed the path
before them, dragging one foot along after another,
with head and shoulders bent in sham sorrow
and reverence; trying, in short, to play-act
the distressed, grief-stricken mourner, touched
to the quick at his own loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had finished his parade, he shook his
stick at the six men, and cursed them, raving
and foaming, for damned scoundrels and thieves
and disrespectful ruffians, who would be glad to
see him dead, and would whistle and dance while
carrying him off, instead of doing it all in the
proper depressed manner he had just shown
them; while the men stood and looked at him
stupidly and sullenly, and, I’ve no doubt, would
have liked to jump on him there and then and
beat him to a pulp, finishing once and for all
with so dreadful a mockery by making it real.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dear Lucy and I stole away, quite shocked
and silent. Afterwards she told me old Crage
had had the coffin a long time, and rehearsed the
funeral once before; but that lately, having by
threats of an action screwed twenty pounds out
of his daughter for money he had lent her (on
which, by-the-way, Miss Crage had promptly run
away and got married), he had had the silver
handles added; and, now that the coffin was, in
his estimation, quite perfect, had doubtless gone
through the unholy ceremony again, so that when
the hour struck there might be no excuse for a
hitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Lucy and I stole away back to “The French
Horn” in shocked silence. Pleasant and human
it sounded, when we got on the road again, to
hear a carter singing as he rattled homeward in
his empty wagon.</p>

I AM FREE OF MABEL HARKER—RETURN TO “THE
FRENCH HORN”—DISASTROUS INTERFERENCE OF
HAROLD FORSYTH IN MY AFFAIRS
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was the 13th of October, as I very well remember,
that, shortly after Mabel’s return to
England from Switzerland, she wrote me an incoherent
epistle, begging me to come up to town
and see her at once, for that she was the most
miserable of girls and had sad news for me,
signed “your heartbroken Mabel.” I must say
I was glad to hear it, and greatly looked forward
to the sad news; since I very well knew it could
only be that another wooer had stepped up on
to the Regent’s Park <span class='it'>tapis</span>, and one a good deal
more determined to win her than I. Directly I
got there and found the fire wasn’t lit in the
drawing-room, though it was horribly cold, I
knew I was right, and the interview was meant
to be brief and painful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same room, by-the-way (though the
fire had been lit for us then!) in which I had
made my unfortunate declaration in the early
spring, soon after Easter—a declaration precipitated
by Mabel, who began playing the piano, but
soon broke down over it and wept, alleging me
to be the cause of her unhappiness; which, being
uncommon tender-hearted where the sex are concerned,
completely bowled me over and drove me
to propose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she came in this time, with melancholy
mouth but unmistakably triumphant eyes, she
at once told me the sad news; to which I listened
with as gloomy a face as I could, demanding in
hoarse tones the name of my successful rival.
I could scarcely contain my mirth when I heard
it was Byles, the man she had so often laughed
at in her letters from Lucerne, as girls not infrequently
do at the man they are one day destined
to marry. But I must say I think she
might at any rate have <span class='it'>offered</span> to send me my
presents back, for there are many of them (particularly
a diamond and sapphire ring—cost me
eighteen pounds) I should have liked to have
given Lucy. I make no manner of doubt that if
it had been garnets and carnelian, I should have
had it back at once in a registered letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly our painful interview was over, I hurried
back to Nesshaven and “The French Horn,”
feeling happier than I had done for months past,
a free man, and my heart beating so rapturously
I believe an old lady in the carriage with me
heard it, she looked so frightened at my restlessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at “The French Horn” a blow awaited
me, from which, when I think of it, I yet reel;
for judge of my stupor when, on my gay return,
I was met, not by Lucy, towards whom I was so
impetuously rushing to tell all, but by the whiskified
thunders of Mr. Thatcher, who took me at
once into the bar-parlor, and proceeded there and
then to claw me about the ears with the angry
rhetoric of a theatrically outraged heavy father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course he was quite right; but then I was
myself <span class='it'>now</span> quite right, too; and when he talked
in real Adelphi fashion about stealing affections
and repaying him in this way, I was—thank
Heaven!—in a position to be angry too, and give
him as good as he gave me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I let him fume on till he ran himself down,
when I temperately explained what my position
really was, and how I was altogether free; and
how, above all, that if Lucy cared for me, as I
very well knew she did, I was going to marry her
at once, and (if not precisely in the immediate
neighborhood of “The French Horn”) settle
down and live happily ever after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Mr. Thatcher’s easily corrugated
brow began as easily to clear, and he steadied himself
and seized and shook me by the wrong hand.
So we sat down and had a cigar and a split whiskey-and-soda,
and he was good enough to say he
had known all along (from the way I had always
paid my bill, I suppose) that he could trust me
implicitly, and all would come right in the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the meantime he had shipped off dear
Lucy to her aunt’s school in the Ladbroke Grove
Road, where she had gone back—very tearfully,
poor child, at the news of my supposed treachery—to
her altogether uncongenial employment
with the younger children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By judicious pumping I discovered it was
Harold Forsyth who had blown upon me and
“queered my pitch,” as showmen say, having
come over from Colchester to play golf, and been
seized upon by the watchful Thatcher, who of
course had noticed my unremitting attentions to
his daughter. Upon which Harold, either because
he fancied it his duty (old friends are often
very inconsiderate) or from sheer stupidity, had
let slip the disastrous news of my engagement
to another lady; though, as a matter of fact, at
the very moment of their conversation it was off
and I was free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Mrs. Thatcher took the situation in at a
glance, and, either from a natural desire to see
her granddaughter properly settled or from pure
friendship for me, who had always been attentive
to her, and once took a bee out of her hair (that
animal being almost the only living thing she
really feared), immediately suggested I should go
off at once to the Ladbroke Grove Road, provided
with a letter to the aunt from Mr. Thatcher,
in which everything was explained, and I was
given authority to interview and settle matters
with my dear sweetheart. So, next morning early,
off I drove to Nesshaven Station in the milk
cart, gay as a lark—that chorister of the poor
and the cheerful well-to-do—and by twelve
o’clock was rattling in a cab down the Ladbroke
Grove Road.</p>

<div class='summary'>
ANGLESEY LODGE—MY INTERVIEW WITH LUCY IN KENSINGTON
GARDENS—NOT SO SATISFACTORY AS I COULD
DESIRE
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a piano-organ playing in front of
Anglesey Lodge as I drove up; it was playing
the old “Les Roses” waltz, and quite dramatic
and affecting the music sounded as I impatiently
waited in the drawing-room, hung with Doré’s
works to impress parents, and with a model of
the Taj under glass, done in soapstone, and sent
by some girl-pupil, I imagine, who had married
and gone out to India.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aunt soon joined me, smiling, with Mr.
Thatcher’s open letter in her hand, and a very
handsome woman she must have been—indeed,
still was—with traces, on a florid scale, of Lucy’s
simple and yet delicate beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was so friendly, and made herself so fascinating,
it was fully half an hour before I could
get away. She told me Lucy was out with some
of the pupils, and that, if I went to Kensington
Gardens and walked down the Broad Walk, I
should be sure to see them. Further, if we
made it up (as we surely should, she graciously
added), she begged me to come back to lunch
at half-past one; though she must ask me not
to walk home with the young ladies through
the streets for fear of adverse neighborly comments,
and upsetting them for the afternoon
studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was soon at the entrance to the gardens in
the Bayswater Road, where the keeper’s lodge is,
with its glass bottles of sweets and half-penny
rock-buns; and, true enough, there was dear
Lucy, sitting on one of the seats facing the
walk, reading to one of the little girls, while the
other bigger ones, perhaps half a dozen of them,
were playing rounders in French, among the trees
and the dead leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Combien de rounders avez-vous?</span>” cried one
of them as I came up; and “<span class='it'>Courrez, Maud,
courrez!</span>” cried another, clapping her hands,
as the tennis-ball in its torn cover whizzed
close by me, whacked by a young person with
a racquet, who was soon off on her round
in a short frock but with uncommonly long
legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I came quite close behind Lucy, taking care
not to make the leaves rustle. She was reading
Bonnechose’s <span class='it'>History of France</span> aloud, something
about the wars of the Fronde and Cardinal
Richelieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>The conduct of the cardinal at this juncture</span>—’ ”
she was saying with great seriousness,
when the little girl beside her, who naturally
wasn’t attending, looked up and saw me. I gave
her a friendly smile, and after that moment’s
careful scrutiny which females of all ages indulge
in, she smiled back. The next moment Lucy
looked at her and then round up at me, giving a
soft, frightened “Hah!” and then going as white
as a sheet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Really, it is quite impossible to say at what
age a comprehension of love, its torments and
its joys, arises in the fresh girlish breast. The
pretty creature seated at Lucy’s side couldn’t
have been more than eleven, but she saw at once
I loved her teacher and desired to be alone with
her; so she immediately rose, staid and composed
as a woman, shook her long hair, and, with
complete unconsciousness, strolled off and joined
the other older girls; while they, not to be behindhand
in delicacy, soon stopped their somewhat
noisy game, and, forming a sympathetic
group at some little distance under an elm, stood
there talking in whispers with their backs to us;
pretending to be immensely interested and absorbed
in the ’buses rumbling down the Bayswater
Road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for her little frightened cry, Lucy received
me in silence, and didn’t even give me
her hand. She sat there on the seat—cut and
scarred with other, happier lovers’ records—with
her head slightly turned away from me; perfectly
composed, apparently, after the first shock and
natural agitation of seeing me again so suddenly
were over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked her how she was and how long she
had been in town; she said she was quite well,
and had been there since the day before yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she said, calmly, “Can you tell me
the time, please?” and on my replying it was
a quarter to one, murmured she must be going
home to dinner, and made as if she would
rise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stopped her with, “Please, Lucy, let me speak
to you first.” So she remained perfectly still,
though with her pretty head still turned away
from me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eloquent, or, at all events, talkative, as I generally
am with the sex, I admit I couldn’t for
the life of me tell how to begin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last I said I was afraid she must think
badly of me, and then waited of course for her
contradiction; but as it never came, and she
never made a sign, I went on to say I shouldn’t
dare approach her were it not I was a free man;
that my affair with—with the other lady was
finally at an end, and so I came to her first and
at once with my whole heart. As I spoke, I
watched her closely, if only in the hope I might
detect some slight twitching of her small ungloved
hands, or some involuntary twittering of
her eyes or lips, when I told her I was free; but
she sat so like an antique, or, for the matter of
that, a modern statue, I began to grow frightened,
since I know very well how implacable even
the tenderest of women can sometimes be when
it suits them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lucy dear!” I stammered, “d-don’t be
hard on me. I loved you the moment I saw you.
I never really loved the other one. Since the
day I first set eyes on you, I have never given
any other woman a serious thought. You can’t
be so unkind as to break my life in pieces, merely
because I’ve been careless, merely because I
spoke to you before I was quite sure I was free?
Why, I was free of her directly I saw you, and if
she hadn’t released me of her own accord, as she
has done—Oh, Lucy! don’t leave me in this
dreadful suspense! Do, my dear girl, say something
kind to me, for mercy’s sake!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t feel kindly towards you, Mr. Blacker,”
Lucy answered, cold and stern, “and I can’t pretend.
I know quite well what’s happened. You
thought I was only an innkeeper’s daughter—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lucy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that so long as you were staying there
you might as well amuse yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love is no amusement, Lucy—it’s a most
fearful trial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But did you ever, when you were daring to
make love to me,” she said, suddenly turning on
me with amazing fierceness, “even cease writing
love letters to her? Tell me that, Mr. Vincent
Blacker!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I groaned; for the truth is I had written more
warmly to Mabel Harker all that delightful month
at “The French Horn” than usual; from the
simple fact that, myself feeling happier, I naturally
wished Mabel to share, in a sense, in my
joy. So what could I do but groan?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we hadn’t found out quite by accident you
were engaged,” Lucy went on, “should we have
ever found it out from you? Were you making
any effort of any sort to free yourself? You
were acting an untruth to me all that time. How
can I tell you are not acting an untruth to me
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t in the least acting an untruth when
I said I loved you. How can you say such a
thing, Lucy dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t call me by my Christian name,”
she answered, pale, and setting her lips tight;
and then she was silent again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very hard on me,” I cried, after a
pause, “and I hope you will never live to regret
it. What could a man do differently, situate so
unfortunately as I was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have been perfectly honest and
frank. At least, you should have made sure you
were off with the old love before you tried to be
on with the new.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you talk as if these things always lay
within our power! I didn’t purposely fall in
love with you—I simply couldn’t help myself!
And into the other affair I had been more or less
entrapped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she replied, with some scorn, “and
three months hence you will be saying exactly
the same thing to the next girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never speak to any one again,” I answered,
solemnly and truly, “as I am speaking
now to you. You can believe me or not, as you
please, but I can never think of any one as I
think of you, and I never have. If you will only
think of me kindly, and try to make excuses for
me; if you will only consult your own heart a
little—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mustn’t allow myself to be turned round
by a few soft speeches,” said Lucy, looking almost
frightened and rising before I could prevent
her. “You have hurt me very much, and
I don’t know that my feelings will ever alter, or
that I should allow them to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will let me see you again?” I humbly
entreated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Certainly not for some little
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may write to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, certainly not!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is all very poor comfort, Lucy,” I
groaned, “after the journey I have taken on
purpose to see you and make it all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What other comfort do you deserve, Mr.
Blacker?” she asked me, haughtily, and immediately
moved away from the seat towards her
young ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will come down at Christmas, if I may,” I
said, tenderly and humbly; but she never replied,
and the next moment was marshalling the girls
for walking home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked to the gate in the Bayswater
Road in a group, and formed up two and two as
they got outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy never turned her head once, but nearly
every young lady treated herself to a look behind;
when they might have seen me plunged down in
melancholy on the seat, digging a morose pattern
into the Broad Walk with the point of my
stick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I drawled back unhappily across the Gardens
and down the empty Row to Hyde Park Corner,
along Piccadilly, and to the club.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Christmas! and this was only October!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sympathetic readers (and I desire no others)
can have no conception what I suffered during
the next few days.</p>

EARLY DIFFICULTIES—I FAIL TO PERSUADE THE HONORABLE
EDGAR FANSHAWE, THE REVEREND PERCY BLYTH,
AND MR. PARKER WHITE, M. P., TO JOIN OUR MONTE
CARLO PARTY
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Lucy</span> declares I have written enough about her,
and now had better get on to the Monte Carlo
part—who went with me, and why they went,
and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I dare say she’s right; for though we neither
of us know anything whatever about writing, she
says she represents the average reader, and, having
been told (as well as I could do it) something
about “The French Horn” and my love-affair
there, is, as an average reader, growing anxious
to learn how I got the party together for so apparently
hazardous, not to say hopeless, an enterprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must just mention, however, that, after my
sad interview with her in Kensington Gardens, I
at once wrote to Mr. Thatcher and told him exactly
what had occurred, informing him of my
intention to come down at Christmas and try
and settle matters with his daughter. At the
same time I begged him to send me up the
clothes and portmanteaus I had left behind me
at “The French Horn.” They arrived, accompanied
by a scrawl from Mr. Thatcher, urging me
to be a man and bear up and all would come right,
and enclosing a rather larger bill than I fancied
I owed, but which I thought it politic to pay
without protest of any kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the old lady, his mother, sent me a line,
in a very upright fist, kindly informing me
“brighter days were in store.” A simple prophecy,
that long has ceased to interest me; since I have
invariably had it from the innumerable fortunetellers,
by cards and tea-leaves and the crystal,
whom for years past I have rather foolishly been
in the habit of consulting, but never derived any
real benefit from.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for my great idea to sack Monte Carlo, it
came to me one morning (quite unexpectedly, as
I have said) when I was lying in bed, trying to
summon up resolution to rise for another dull
and irksome day. It was still a long time off
Christmas, and life was lying on me with extreme
heaviness; for, as I think I have explained, I am
in the militia, and when once my month’s training
is over have nothing to do with myself except
live on my eight hundred a year and amuse
myself as best I can; and my idleness was rendered
further indigestible at this period by the
unhappy state of my relations with dear Lucy,
whom I could neither see nor write to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the idea that I should get a small, resolute
party together, and raid the tables at Monte
Carlo, brought a new interest into my life; and
after making a few quiet and judicious inquiries
(for I had never been there), I determined to set
about the affair in earnest and see if I could get
any one to join me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first efforts in that direction, as is generally
the case with anything new and startling,
were not at all successful; but the more opposition
and ridicule I met with, the more obstinate
and determined I became. As for the morality
of the affair, that, as I have said, has never
troubled me from first to last. Does any one
think of calling the police immoral when they
go and raid a silver gambling-hell in Soho? For
the life of me I have never been able to see the
difference between us, except that <span class='it'>in our case</span>
there was needed a greater nerve and address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now my sister, Mrs. Rivers, the wife of the
publisher, lives in Medworth Square, S. W., and,
on considering her intimates, I made up my mind
to approach the Honorable Edgar Fanshawe first.
He has a brother in the Foreign Office, and relations
scattered about everywhere in government
employ, so I decided he would be a good man to
have with us in case the affair proved a <span class='it'>fiasco</span>
and we all got into trouble, a chance that naturally
had to be provided for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanshawe, I should explain, was at one time
in the Guards, but now writes the most dreadfully
dull historical novels, which my brother-in-law
publishes, and no one that I have ever met
reads. Every autumn, sure as fate, among the
firm’s list of new books you see announced,
<span class='it'>Something or Other, a Tale of the Young Pretender</span>;
or, <span class='it'>Something or Other Else, an Episode of
the Reign of Terror</span>; with quotations from the
<span class='it'>Scots Herald</span>, “this enthralling story”; or, from
the <span class='it'>Dissenters’ Times</span>, “no more powerful and
picturesque romance has at present issued,” etc.
Or <span class='it'>The Leeds Commercial Gazette</span> would declare
it “the best historical novel since Scott,” which
I seem to have heard before of many other dull
works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanshawe is a purring, mild, genteel, rather
elderly person, who listens to everything you are
good enough to say most attentively and politely,
with his head on one side, and never will be
parted from his opera-hat. When I attacked
him one night after dinner in Medworth Square
he was in his usual autumnal condition of beatitude
at the excellence of the reviews of his
latest historical composition (which, as usual,
scarcely sold), and beamed on me with delighted
condescension, stuffing quantities of raisins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What shall you be doing in January?” I
cautiously began. “Would you be free for a little
run over to Monte Carlo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, the Honorable Edgar is the sort
of person who, half an hour after dinner, will
undertake to do anything with anybody, and then
write and get out of it immediately after breakfast
next morning, when he’s cold; so I quite
expected the reply that Monte Carlo in January
would suit him exactly, and what hotel did I
propose to stay at?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I’ve an idea,” I went on, drawing a little
closer. “You’ve been to Monte Carlo, of
course, and know what a quantity of money
there is in the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of it mine,” smiled Fanshawe. “I
beg your pardon for interrupting you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “how would you like to join
a little party of us for the purpose of getting it
back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A syndicate to work a system?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing so unprofitable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know of any other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My idea,” I went on, sinking my voice, “is
shortly this: that half a dozen of us should join
and take a yacht—a fast steam-yacht—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather an expensive way of doing it, isn’t
it?” objected Fanshawe, in alarm. He doesn’t
mind what he pays to have his books published,
but is otherwise mean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not when you consider the magnitude of the
stakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the most you can win, even if you break
the bank, is only a hundred thousand francs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But consider the number of the tables, to
say nothing of the reserve in the vaults, and the
money lying about already staked!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old boy looked puzzled, but nodded his
head politely all the same. “That’s true,” he
said, vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The place is not in any sense guarded, as no
doubt you remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t know that I ever saw a soldier
about, except one or two, very bored, on sentry
go, up at Monaco. But what has that to do with
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, half a dozen resolute men with revolvers
could clear the whole place out in five minutes,”
I murmured, seductively. “The steam-yacht
lies in the harbor, we collect the money, or
as much of it as half a dozen of us can carry
away, and, once on board the lugger—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanshawe pushed his chair back and stared at
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—We go full-steam ahead to one of the Greek
islands, divide the swag, scuttle the steamer,
make our way to the Piræus, inspect the Acropolis,
and come home, <span class='it'>viâ</span> Corfu, as Cook’s tourists.
Or go to the Holy Land, eh, by way of
completely averting suspicion?” And I winked
and nudged him, nearly falling over in my effort
to get at his frail old ribs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear friend!” gasped the startled Fanshawe;
“why propose such an elaborate pleasantry?
It’s like school-boy’s talk in a dormitory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never felt further from my school-days in
my life,” I answered with determination. “The
affair is perfectly easy—easier than you think.
All it wants is a little resolution, and the money’s
ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s simple robbery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t imagine,” I at once replied, “I
propose anything so coarse as burglary and the
melting-pot. No; I say to myself, here is the
most iniquitous establishment in Europe, simply
reeking with gold, of which an enormous surplus
remains at the end of the year to be divided,
principally among Semitic Parisians, who lavish
it on their miserable pleasures. Here, on the
other hand, are numerous deserving establishments
in London—hospitals and so on—with
boards out, closing their wards and imploring
subscriptions. The flow of gold has evidently
got into the wrong channels, as it always will if
not sharply looked after. Be ours the glorious
enterprise to divert it anew—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good friend,” interrupted Fanshawe, “if
I thought you serious—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never was more serious in my life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, gracious me, suppose you’re all caught?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, there is a prison up at Monaco, I believe,”
I answered, lightly; “but they tell me
prisoners come and go just as they please. That
doesn’t in the least alarm me. Besides, Europe
would be on our side—at all events, the respectable
portion of it—and would hail our <span class='it'>coup</span> with
rapture, even if it ended in failure. And with
your brother in the Foreign Office, they’d soon
have you back. Now what do you say? Will
you make one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Blacker, you really must be crazy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At a given signal, when the rooms are fullest,
some of us—two would be enough—drive the
gamblers into a corner and make them hold
up their hands. The others loot the tables
and the vaults. Then we turn out the electric
light—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any more wine, Fanshawe?” called out my
brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanshawe rose, and I saw at once by the limp
way he pulled his waistcoat down he was no good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, as I followed him into the
drawing-room, “if you won’t join us, you must
give me your word not to breathe a syllable of
what we are going to do. It’s an immense idea,
and I don’t want any one to get hold of it first,
and find the place gutted by some one else before
we can get a look in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fanshawe’s only reply was that if I got into
trouble he would thank me not to apply to him
to bail me out; so we mutually promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I don’t know that, on the whole, I very much
regretted him; he is, after all, a very muddle-headed,
nervous old creature; but my hopes
were for a time a good deal dashed by the refusal
of the Reverend Percy Blyth to join us (much as
he approved of the scheme), though I did my best
to tempt him with the offer of new stops for his
organ out of the boodle. He is the clergyman
of St. Blaise’s, Medworth Square, and intimate
with all the theatrical set, for whom he holds
services at all sorts of odd hours; the natural
result of which is he is on the free list of nearly
every theatre, and has given me many a
box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now every school-boy knows how priceless the
presence of a parson is to all human undertakings—on
a race-course, for instance, for thimble-rigging,
the three-card trick, and other devices.
They call him the <span class='it'>bonnet</span>, and if you have any
trifling dispute about there being no pea, or the
corner of the card being turned down, you are
likely to be very much astonished to find the
clergyman (who, of course, is only a cove dressed
up) take the proprietor’s part and, at a pinch,
offer to fight you, or any other dissatisfied bystander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I naturally thought it would be a good
thing for us if we had a real parson in the party,
if only as a most superior <span class='it'>bonnet</span>, to avert suspicion;
though, if I had only thought a little, I
might have known the idea wouldn’t work, since
Blyth couldn’t very well have gone into the Casino
rooms in parson’s rig, and I didn’t really want
him for anything else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only one other of my sister’s friends
I approached on the subject before I had recourse
to my own—Parker White, a bouncing sort of
young man who had just got into the House of
Commons, and who, I thought, might possibly
be useful. But, as I cautiously felt my way with
him, he looked so frightened, and talked such
balderdash about his position and filibustering
and European complications (complications with
Monaco, if you please, with an army of seventy
men!) that I pretended it was all a joke and
turned the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To tell the truth, I was not much disappointed
in Parker White, since I know very well how
most of those younger men in the House are all
gas and no performance; but, all the same, he
was pretty cunning; for, to put it vulgarly, he
lay low and waited, and when talk began to get
about of what we had done, and the Casino Company’s
shares fell immediately in consequence of
our success, he bought them up like ripe cherries;
and then, when it was all contradicted by a subsidized
press (which made me wild and drove me
to writing this work in self-defence), and the
shares jumped up again, he promptly sold and
made a good thing out of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he has never had the grace to thank me
for putting the opportunity in his way; which
is so like those men in the House who speculate
on their information on the sly and then blush
to find it fame.</p>

<h2 id='p47'>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<div class='summary'>
I INTERVIEW MR. BRENTIN—HIS SYMPATHY AND INTEREST—SIR
ANTHONY HIPKINS AND THE YACHT <span class='it'>AMARANTH</span>—WE
DETERMINE TO LOOK OVER IT
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I soon</span> began to see that, out of so conventional
an atmosphere as Medworth Square, I was not
likely to gather any great profit to my scheme;
that, if my idea were ever to bear fruit, I must
set to work among my own particular friends in
my own way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On thinking them over, I determined to approach
Mr. Julius C. Brentin first, an American
gentleman whom I knew to be above prejudice,
and to whom I could talk with perfect freedom
and security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is a man of about fifty-five, a Californian,
of medium height (which, like many Americans,
he always pronounces <span class='it'>heighth</span>), with black hair,
black eyebrows, and a small black mustache. He
carries cigars loose in every pocket, and he will
drink whiskey with you with great good-humor
till the subject of the immortality of the soul
crops up, when he suddenly becomes angry, suspicious,
and, finally, totally silent. And that
subject he always introduces himself, though for
what reason I never can conceive, unless it be to
quarrel and part. I had met him in the street a
day or two before, when he told me he had recently
married a New York young lady and was
staying at the “Victoria”; he begged me to come
and call, and on going there I found him chewing
a green cigar in the smoking-room, his hat
on the bridge of his pugnacious nose, and a glass
of Bourbon whiskey beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He reached me out a hand from the depths of
his breeches pocket, as though he had just found
it there and desired to make me a present of it,
and pulled me down by his side. Then he gave
me a long, black cigar out of his waistcoat pocket,
worked his own round to the farther corner of
his mouth, while with a solemn gesture he pointed
to his trousers, carefully turned up over small
patent-leather boots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Blacker,” he said, “observe my pants.
I am endeavoring to please Mrs. Brentin; I am
striving to be English. You English invariably
turn up the bottom of your pants; it is economical
and it is fashionable, don’t yer know.” And
Mr. Brentin winked at me a glittering, beady
black eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hoped Mrs. Brentin was quite well, and he
replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. Brentin has gone way off to Holborn,
sir; she has organized an expedition with Mrs.
William Chivers, ay socially prominent Philadelphian,
in search of the scene of the labors of
your Mrs. Gamp. From there she goes to the
Marshalsea, to discover traces of Little Dorrit.
She knows your Charles Dickens by heart, sir,
and she follows him ayround. This is her first
visit to the old country, and I humor her tastes,
which are literary and high-toned, by staying at
home and practising the English accent. I have
studied the English accent theoretically, and I
trace it to the predominance among your people
of the waist muscles. We as a nation are deficient
in waist muscles. So I stay at home and
exercise them in the refined society of any stranger
who can be indooced to talk with me. It is
a labor of some difficulty, Mr. Blacker, which is
gradually driving me to drink; for the strangers
in this hotel are shy, and apt to regard me in the
unflattering light of ay bunco-steerer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin sighed, drank, and worked his jaw
and cigar with the solemnity of a cow masticating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At other times, sir,” he drawled, “I stroll a
block or two, way down the Strand. I compose
my features and endeavor to assoom the vacant
expression of ay hayseed or countryman. I have
long desired to be approached by one of your
confidence-trick desperadoes, but my success so
far has been mighty small. They keep away from
me, sir, as though I had the <span class='it'>grippe</span>. I apprehend,
Mr. Blacker, that in my well-meant efforts
to look imbecyle, I only look cunning. If they
would only try me with the green-goods swindle,
I should feel my time was not being altogether
misspent. It is plaguy disheartening, and I might
as well be back in Noo York for all the splurge
I am making over here. And how have you
been putting in your time, sir, since last year,
when we went down to the Durby—I should say,
the Darby—together?” he asked, turning his
head my way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On any other day, I have no doubt, I should
have given Mr. Brentin a spirited and somewhat
lengthy sketch of my doings during the last year
and a half; but my recent failures in Medworth
Square had taught me the value of time, and I
plunged at once into the real object of my visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly, in rapid, clear-cut outline, I began
to make my scheme clear, Mr. Brentin turned
and looked at me; from the rigid lines of my
speaking countenance he saw at once I was in
earnest, and transferred his gaze to his pants and
boots. Once only he gave me another rapid
look, an ocular upper-cut, apparently to satisfy
himself of my sincerity, when my mask spoke
so strongly of enthusiasm and determination I
felt I had completely reassured him, and was, in
fact, gradually overhauling his will. As I went
on, he began to breathe gustily through his nose
and give a series of small kicks with his varnished
toe, indications of growing ardor for the enterprise
and a desire to immediately set about it
that simply enchanted me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I descended to details, it was my turn
to watch him. The cigar he was chewing was a
complete indicator of his frame of mind. As I
spoke of half a dozen resolute men with revolvers,
it rose to the horizontal; when I mentioned the
steam-yacht and a bolt for the harbor, it drooped
like a trailed stick; while, as I sketched our rapid
flight to the Greek Archipelago and division of
the spoil, it stuck up like a peacock’s tail, a true
standard of revolt against the narrowness and
timidity of our modern life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American mind works so quickly I was
not at all surprised when Mr. Brentin suddenly
sat up, took the cigar out of his mouth, and hurled
it to the other end of the smoking-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bravo! for I knew it signified away with prejudice,
away with conventionality, away, above
all, with fear! It was a silent, triumphant “<span class='it'>Jacta
est alea, Rubicon transibimus!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he turned to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Blacker,” he excitedly whispered, “by
the particular disposition of Providence there is
a party now lying up-stairs, ay titled gentleman
with an enlarged liver, the fruit of some years
spent in your colonial service, who owns and desires
to part with one, at all events, of the instruments
of this enterprise of ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The yacht?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The steam-yacht, sir. It is called the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>,
and lies at this moment at Ryde.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the owner’s name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was good enough to introdooce himself
to me one afternoon last week in the parlor as
Sir Anthony Hipkins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hipkins? That doesn’t sound right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” replied Mr. Brentin, “I know very little
of your titled aristocracy, but I admit it did
not sound right to me. However, I talked it
over with my friend, the clerk in the bureau, and
he assured me that Hipkins is his real name;
that he has been for some years judge on the
Gold Coast, and, by the personal favor of your
Queen Victoria, has been lately elevated to the
dignity of knighthood, as some compensation for
his complaint caught in the service. He had
the next room to us, but the midnight groaning-act
in which he occasionally indulged was too
much for Mrs. Brentin, and we were forced to
shift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he spoken to you about his yacht?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He introdooced himself right here in the
parlor, and offered it me for three thousand
pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I presented him to Mrs. Brentin right away,
as I invariably do when I want an inconvenient
request refused. She explained that ay steam-yacht
was very little use to her in the journeys
she is at present taking about this city in search
of the localities of Charles Dickens. Whereupon
Judge Hipkins, who impressed me as being
brainy, immediately replied, ‘What about Yarmouth
and little Em’ly’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did Mrs. Brentin say to that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sir, Mrs. Brentin thought three thousand
pounds too much to pay for the privilege of
approaching Yarmouth by sea; more especially
as she is a bad sailor, and commences to be sick
at her stomach before leaving the kay-side. Now,
however, Mr. Blacker,” he said, rising, “we will,
if you please, go and find Sir Anthony Hipkins,
and we will buy his steam-yacht.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rapidity of the American mind somewhat
alarmed me; still, I felt there was nothing for it
but to follow Mr. Brentin. He went straight to
the bureau, and, on inquiring for Sir Anthony,
learned he was up-stairs ill in bed, and that his
wife was with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we went up in the lift, Mr. Brentin winked
at me. “It is in our favor, sir, that the judge
is sick; we will be sympathetic, but we will
not offer more than two thousand five hundred
pounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We found No. 246, and Mr. Brentin knocked.
A deep groaning voice called to us to come in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The judge must be real bad if he has sent
for his wife,” observed Mr. Brentin. “On reflection,
we will try him with two thousand. Come
right alawng in, sir, and I will present you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I followed him into the bedroom, and there we
found Sir Anthony lying, propped up in bed.
He was a long, gaunt man, with a grizzling
beard, a hook-nose, like a tulwar, and a quantity
of rough, brown hair turning gray. By his side
was sitting a small, dry, prim old lady, reading
from a book, with gold pince-nez, and notwithstanding
our entrance she went steadily on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop that now, Nanny,” Sir Anthony called,
fretfully, stretching his hand out of the bed over
the page, “and let us hear what these men want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Anthony and Lady Hipkins,” said Mr.
Brentin, politely, with a bow to each, his hat in
his hand, “permit me to present to you my
young friend, Mr. Vincent Blacker. He is in
want of a yacht, and though he has his eye on
several, would be glad to learn particulars of
yours before concluding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Anthony rolled his bony head on the pillow
and groaned. Directly he withdrew his hand
from the page the dry old lady went on with her
reading in a curious, dull, flat voice. Mr.
Brentin came to the foot of the bed, and, leaning
his arms on the brass rail, surveyed him sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you too sick, judge,” he asked, “to discuss
business matters with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>And in the eleventh year of Joram, the son of
Ahab</span>—” droned her ladyship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away, Nanny,” shouted Sir Anthony,
pointing to the opposite door; “go into the next
room, or go out and take a walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin opened the door, and, after putting
the Bible on the bed under Sir Anthony’s
big nose, Lady Hipkins left the room quietly, as
she was directed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re Mr. Brentin, ain’t you?” asked the
judge. “Beg your pardon for not recognizing
you. What did you say your friend’s name was?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin explained that I was Mr. Vincent
Blacker, a gentleman of position and the highest
integrity, an officer in Queen Victoria’s militia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ah!” said the judge, sitting up in bed
and scratching his legs ruefully. “And he wants
to buy a yacht?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has almost concluded for the purchase of
one,” Mr. Brentin replied, “but I have suggested
he should wait—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge began most unexpectedly to laugh,
bending his head between his knees and stifling
his merriment with the counterpane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The judge is better,” observed Mr. Brentin,
with a wave of his hand. “The presence of
gentlemen who sympathize with his complaint,
and the likelihood of completing—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s too damn ridiculous,” laughed the judge,
“to be caught shamming Abraham like this, by
George! Serves me right. You see, Mr. Blacker,
after three years of the Gold Coast I was naturally
anxious to see whether London had greatly altered
in my absence, and, consequently, neglected
to go and reside at Norwood with her ladyship.
Whereupon her ladyship wrote, demanding the
reason of my lengthy stay in the metropolis.
What was I to do but say I was too ill to move,
but that the minute I was well enough—” Sir
Anthony went off laughing again, and I laughed
too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that midnight groaning-act of yours,
judge,” asked the shocked Brentin, “which so
much disturbed and alarmed Mrs. Brentin and
myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that was genuine enough,” chuckled Sir
Anthony; “but it was more the thought of having
to go to Norwood and attend the concerts at
the Crystal Palace than any actual physical pain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin’s visage clouded over, and he
grew sombre and grave. With true American
chivalry, he could not bear the idea of any one
imposing on a woman, especially an old and plain
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“However,” said the judge, “I’m rightly punished
by her ladyship’s descending on me and
forcing me to go to bed—not to mention the
Book of Kings, and all my smoke cut off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will be ay lesson to you, judge, I trust,”
observed Mr. Brentin, sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First and second lesson, by George! And
now let’s talk about the yacht. Your friend
wants to buy a yacht?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must say I was a good deal alarmed at Brentin’s
coolness and precipitancy in so readily bringing
me forward as purchaser of the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>,
and, as I listened to their conversation, quite
made up my mind not to bind myself irrevocably
to anything. Three, or even two, thousand
pounds! My idea was doubtless a remarkable
one, but I had no notion of backing it to that
amount—at all events, with my own money. So,
with an air of sham gravity, I listened, assuming as
solid an air of wealth as I could on so short a
notice, determined at the last moment to make
the necessary fatal objections, which would finally
effectually prevent my being saddled with the
thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge explained that the yacht had only
just been left him by an uncle who had died very
suddenly in the “Albany”; that it was in complete
order, ready victualled and manned; that
it had usually been sent round to the Riviera, and
joined there overland by his uncle, who spent the
winter months on board till the advent of spring
enabled him to return to London; that there it
was lying at Ryde, awaiting his orders, and that he
had accidentally heard that Captain Evans, in default
of instructions, was actually employing it
for excursions on his own behalf, and taking the
Ryde people for trips in the Solent and runs over
to Bournemouth at so much a head when the
weather was favorable; which would all have
to be accounted for, added the judge, of course.
It was a large yacht, of about four hundred
tons, and, rather than be bothered with it, the
judge would let it go for three thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you go down and see it,” he
asked, “before you decide? And, if I were you,
I wouldn’t let Evans know you are coming; if it’s
a fine day, you are sure to catch him at some of
his little games, and that’ll give you a hold over
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three thousand pounds is ay large sum of
money, judge,” objected Mr. Brentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not bad; but then it’s a large yacht. Now
look here, don’t you haggle with me,” he went
on, irritably, “because I don’t like it. You can
either take it or leave it. I won’t let it go for a
penny less. Rather than that, I’ll go and live on
board and spend my time crossing between Portsmouth
and the island. I should be safe from
her ladyship, at any rate, for even coming up in
the lift upsets her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shook his hand and left him composing
himself to receive Lady Hipkins again. She was
walking up and down the corridor as we came
out, and Mr. Brentin went up to her and bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The judge is real bad, ma’am,” he said, with
great gravity, “and should not be left. He has
been explaining to us what a comfort you and
your reading are to him, and how much he looks
forward to being taken down to Norwood and
nursed back to his former robust health at your
hands. If I may venture to advise, you should
procure a hotel conveyance as soon as possible
and drive him way down home by easy stages.
The air in this city, ma’am, is not good for ay
man of the judge’s temperament and physique.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a kind face,” her ladyship answered,
in her strange, flat voice, “and mean
kindly, I am sure. But I am extremely deaf,
and have not heard one word you have said.
Perhaps you would kindly write it down for me?”
she added, handing him a little book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s of no consequence,” bawled Mr. Brentin
through his hands. “Good-afternoon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why doesn’t the old shakes carry a trumpet”
he said, angrily, as we went down-stairs.
“What’s the matter with a trumpet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hall, before leaving him, I hastened to
explain I had no thought of expending three
thousand pounds in the purchase of Sir Anthony’s
or any yacht whatsoever; that my contribution
to the expedition would be the idea, and
so many of the resolute men as I could lay hands
on among my friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be all right, Mr. Blacker,” Brentin
loftily replied; “I will see after the yacht portion
of the affair. It can be made good to me, if I run
short, out of the boodle, and, if it all fails, I have
no doubt I shall have my money value in excitement.
In the meantime, sir, let us waltz in and
secure the yacht, to begin with. If you will be
free in the morning, we will descend upon Ryde
and Captain Evans. If we find him going to sea,
so much the better; we shall have the opportunity
of testing the sailing capacities of the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>.
Good-day to you, sir. I have to thank
you for infusing my exhossted veins with a breath
of the true spirit of the forty-niners, who made
the State of California what she is. The holding
up of ay Sacramento bank will be nothing to
this, sir, if we don’t spile—that is, spoil—it.”</p>

WE GO TO RYDE—THE <span class='it'>AMARANTH</span>—ACCIDENTAL MEETING
WITH ARTHUR MASTERS AND HIS LADY FRIEND—I
ENROLL HIM AMONG US PROVISIONALLY—WE DECIDE
TO PURCHASE THE YACHT
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I don’t</span> know that it would be altogether necessary
to the course of the narrative of this work
to say much about our visit to Ryde and the
<span class='it'>Amaranth</span> were it not that, while there, we accidentally
encountered Arthur Masters, an old
friend and school-fellow of mine. He was staying
at Seaview, and, being in a mazed condition
of lovelornness (for nothing short of it would
have induced him to neglect the harriers of which
he is master in Hertfordshire), had come over for
the day with the young lady, and was spending
it there mainly on the pier, being uncommonly
warm and fine for November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin and I had just arrived, and were
keeping our weather-eye open for the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>,
when we came on Arthur and his young lady sitting
on the pier in the sun. She was introduced
to us as Miss Rybot, and wore a straw-hat and a
shirt, just as though it were summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We told them we had come down about a
yacht, and, if we could only find her, were thinking
of making a small trial-trip across the Solent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we were talking and persuading them to
accompany us, up comes a sailor in a blue jersey,
with <span class='it'>Amaranth</span> across it in red, and hands us a
printed bill.</p>

<div class='blockquoter9'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The</span> Amaranth, <span class='it'>fast steam-yacht (Captain Evans, Commander),
will sail daily from Hyde pier-head (weather permitting)
for a two hours’ trip in the Solent. Fares: Saloon,
half a crown; fore cabin, one shilling</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Doing much business?” asked Mr. Brentin
carelessly, cocking his eye on the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty fair, mister,” the sailor replied, “when
the weather’s like this. There’s a good few aboard
already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there?” Mr. Brentin innocently remarked.
“All right. Give Captain Evans Sir Anthony
Hipkins’s compliments and say we will come
aboard right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Anthony! Lord love you!” ejaculated
the sailor, and was off pretty fast down to the
pier-head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will give the captain a few minutes to
clear out his Ryde friends,” observed Mr. Brentin
with a wink, “and then we will pro-ceed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, sure enough, as we got leisurely down to
the pier-head there we found a boat just landing
from the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>, half a dozen excursionists
in her with hand-bags and bottles, talking fast
among themselves and giving frightened glances
back at the yacht lying in the tideway two or
three hundred yards off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything wrong on board, my friend?”
drawled Mr. Brentin to a large, puce-faced man
with a red comforter loosely knotted round his
throat, as he clambered up the pier steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anythin’ wrong?” echoed the terrified man.
“Captain says rust ’as suddenly got into the b’ilers
and ’e’s afraid they’ll bust. That’s all!—Mother,
where’s Emma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall have the ship to ourselves,” remarked
Mr. Brentin. “Music provided, too.
Sakes alive!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The music was a harp, a cornet, and a stout
woman with a large accordion slung on her back.
The cornettist, a battered-looking young man
with one eye, carried a shell for collecting the
money, and a camp-stool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t go!” drawled Mr. Brentin; “we
have a passion for music on the waters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ave you?” cried the sarcastic cornettist.
“Well, I ’ope you’ll like gittin’ blown up, too.
Full steam a’ead, mates! Now then, missis, out
of the way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off they all trooped together as fast as they
could down the length of the pier, giving occasional
frightened glances back at the yacht, which
began to blow us a sycophantish salute with her
whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only person who will get blown up to-day,”
observed Mr. Brentin as he took his seat
in the boat, “will be Captain Evans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this time Miss Rybot had scarcely said a
word. She was rather a haughty, not to say
disagreeable-looking, young lady; tall, slightly
freckled, with a high nose and a quantity of
beautiful auburn hair. She appeared to take the
situation with the utmost indifference, and not
in the least to care whether she stayed on shore
or went to sea and never came back. Altogether
the sort of young lady who might lead an adorer
rather a dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get under way at once, if you please, Captain
Evans,” said Mr. Brentin, sternly, as we
came on board and found the captain waiting
for us, exceedingly alarmed, his cap in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, sir!” bleated the captain. “Where
to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere where we can give the yacht’s speed
a fair trial. What’s the matter with our going
round the island?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing the matter with it, sir, that
I am aware of,” answered the startled Evans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then make it so! And then come and give
me a few moments’ conversation in the saloon.
For the use of which,” Mr. Brentin gravely
added, “I do not propose to pay half a dollar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, sir!” And off we bustled towards
Spithead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where will you sit, Miss Rybot?” Masters
asked, humbly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere out of the wind,” was the indifferent
answer; “and be good enough, please, to
leave me to myself for a little. I wish to collect
my thoughts, and you have, no doubt, a good
deal to talk over with your friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unfortunate Masters found her a sheltered
seat (which she soon left and selected another),
wrapped her legs in a rug (which she promptly
threw off), and then came and sat himself down
by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s an orphan,” he whispered, biting his
nails, “and has to teach. I met her at Seaview.
She has forty pounds a year of her own, and has
one little nasty pupil, whom she loathes. She’s a
strict Roman Catholic, and talks of entering a
convent, but she’s a good deal in debt, and wants
to pay off her debts first. She talks of going to
Monte Carlo and winning enough at the tables to
pay her debts, and then becoming a Poor Clare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Poor Clare?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re a strictly enclosed order,” he groaned;
“they keep a perpetual fast, have no beds, and
go barefooted. They spend all their time in
prayer and meditation, and live on alms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then they don’t marry, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I tell you they’re strictly enclosed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you known her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About a month. I met her at a friend’s
house at Seaview.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you said anything to her yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing very definite. I was going to to-day.
But I don’t believe it will be any use,” he
sighed; “she seems bent on the convent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think she suspects your attachment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she must by this time. I’ve given up
several days’ golf for her. But she’s so confoundedly
independent and thinks so badly of
men. She fancies they’re all after her because
she’s poor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extraordinary young person!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she says that if a man knows a girl’s
poor he always believes she’s only too ready to
marry him, just to escape from teaching and secure
a comfortable home. That’s the sort of girl
she is; she swears she won’t be purchased. What
am I to do? What do you advise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave him plenty of sound advice, but could
see he wasn’t attending to me. At last he roused
himself to ask about my affairs. He had heard
the Mabel Harker entanglement was over, and
naturally supposed there was some one else. So
off I went about Lucy and “The French Horn,”
describing her minutely, and how unhappy I was,
and how I was going down there at Christmas to
make it all up, and that in the meantime—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you would speak to her to-day and get
some definite answer out of her?” he asked, biting
his nails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I to-day, when she’s miles away in
the Ladbroke Grove Road?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Masters stared, and I saw, of course, he hadn’t
been attending and was only thinking of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his mind in so confused and despondent
a condition, I judged the opportunity excellent
to try and get him to join us; so, after a few cautious
preliminaries, I drew closer and let him into
the whole secret of our visit to Ryde and trial
of the yacht, giving him to understand that Mr.
Brentin was already one of the heads of the enterprise,
and that, if I couldn’t get the necessary
half-dozen resolute Englishmen, he would easily
fill their places with the same number of ditto
Americans, from the hotels in Northumberland
Avenue; which would cause me some national
shame, I said, and give me ground for fearing
the ancient spirit of the country was really gone
and dribbled off into mere stock-jobbing, as so
many people assert—Drake and the Gilberts and
Raleigh having shuffled into Capel Court, touting
on curb-stones like Hamburg peddlers or
ready-money pencillers, instead of taking the
broad and daring road of nerve and valor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further, I seductively pointed out there would
be no sort of reason why Miss Rybot shouldn’t
be of the party and try legitimately to win enough
at the tables to pay her debts, if her heart was
set on it; which would free her from all obligation
towards him and bring about their marriage
in the most natural way; and that if a chaperon
were needed, I would engage to supply one,
whether the young lady went to Monte Carlo by
land or by sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I had already experienced, different men
take an announcement of this high order in different
ways—some are shocked, some incredulous;
some see all the difficulties at once, some
never see any. As for Arthur Masters, he was in
such a state of depression that I believe if I had
said, “Arthur, we are going North to root up the
Pole; will you make one?” he’d have answered,
“Delighted!” and been off to Beale &amp; Inman’s at
once to order the necessary outfit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At all events, what he did say was, that if Miss
Rybot could be induced to come, he would certainly
come too, and do his best, charging himself
with the duty of feeling his way with her,
and promising to let me know the result as soon
as possible. He only stipulated he should not
be away longer than a fortnight in January, because
of his harriers, which all this time were
being rather inefficiently hunted by his younger
brother and the dog boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We got back safely to Ryde, thoroughly satisfied
with our outing and the behavior of the
<span class='it'>Amaranth</span>, and caught the six-o’clock train back
to Victoria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin had unfortunately taken a strong
dislike to Miss Rybot, and imitated her cold,
haughty “Really! you don’t say so!” and other
stand-offish little speeches, most of the way up.
The imitation was not in the least like, of course,
but served to show me the scornful bent of his
mind towards her. When I told him I had secured
Masters on the condition she came too, he
grew quite angry, and declared that whatever
route she took he should most certainly take the
other, rather than be frozen in her society. He
added, as a further ground of dislike, she was
“pop-eyed”—a somewhat unjust description of
her slightly prominent, large, cold, gray optics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Captain Evans and his little game of
using the yacht for excursions on his own account,
the captain had given the, to me, rather
lame explanation that yachts left idle came to no
good, and should, in short, be taken out for exercise
just like horses. Questioned why he didn’t
go out without company, he averred he must
have ballast or the yacht would throb her sides
out, and that he thought he might as well make
the ballast pay. Also that he had kept a most
careful record of receipts, and was prepared to
account for every farthing to the rightful owners,
whoever they should turn out to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In short, as is so often the case, Captain Evans
had managed to prove quite conclusively that Mr.
Brentin was entirely in the wrong in suspecting
his proceedings, and that he was a much injured
and wholly innocent British sailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, sir,” said Mr. Brentin, chewing his
cigar as we rattled along in the train, “has happened
to me more than once with your lower
orders. I go into my tailor’s with my noo coat
bulging at the back, bursting with ay sense of
injury at the misfit considering the price I have
paid. And that tailor keeps cool while I stamp
around; he surveys me with ay pitying smile, he
calls up his assistants to admire the fit, and he
proves to me con-clusively that the best part of
that coat is precisely the bulge in the back, and
that I shall injure his reputation and ruin the
coat if I have it touched. I enter that store,
sir, like ay raging lion, and I leave it ay teething
lamb, my mouth overflowing with apologies,
which the damn tailor will scarcely accept. And
I know he thinks, ‘What infernal fools these
Yankees are!’ and is laafing at me in his sleeve
as the bulge and I disappear in the crowd of his
other misfits, and are lost in the night of his paid
accounts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same evening the purchase of the yacht
was concluded by Mr. Brentin, as he wrote me
in the morning; directing me, further, to go right
ahead and get the rest of my desperadoes together
for a dash on the tables in January. He added
in a postscript that, for his part, he was going
into the city early next morning to buy three
fair-sized cannon, capable of throwing three fair-sized
shells; for, in case anything went wrong
and we were captured, it would be just as well
to leave orders with Captain Evans to shell the
Casino, and so continue till we were released and
replaced on board the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>, with a guarantee
for our expenses, and an undertaking for no
further molestation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bold as I am, owing in some measure to my
militia training, the rapidity of the American
mind was again causing me some considerable
qualms.</p>

<div class='summary'>
MY SISTER’S SUSPICIONS—HEROES OF <span class='it'>THE ARGO</span>—MY
SISTER DETERMINES TO COME WITH US AS CHAPERON
TO MISS RYBOT
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>From</span> now right on to Christmas I lived in a
constant hurry and ferment of excitement; for
not only was I full of every sort of preparation
for our adventure, but every day brought me
nearer “The French Horn” and my seeing
dear Lucy once more. By the second week in
December I had at last got our party of six
together; to which number, for the present, at
any rate, by Mr. Brentin’s advice, it was determined
to limit it. If it were to be done at all,
he said, six could easily do it, and by adding
more we were only increasing the danger of the
affair leaking out and the people at the tables
being forewarned and forearmed; neither of
which, though more particularly the latter, did
we at all desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly the party was complete, I informed
Mr. Brentin, and by his directions gave them all
a rendezvous at “The French Horn” for Christmas.
He wished to see us all together he said,
and take our measure; not that he doubted I
had chosen the right sort, but rather that he
might consider what post should be assigned to
each—who should lead the van and who should
guard the rear, and who, if necessary, should
form the reserve and direct the shell-throwing
on the Casino in case of our capture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime I had been so busy running over
the country, interviewing and persuading, and
by many being point-blank refused, that I had
quite neglected my sister, Mrs Rivers, and Medworth
Square; and whether it was she suspected
something from my continued absence, or something
had leaked out through Parker White, I
never could quite discover; but, at any rate, she
one day sent for me to come to tea, and attacked
me at once to know what I was doing and why
I never came to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From very early days my sister Muriel has
been my confidante in everything. My father I
scarcely remember, beyond the fact that he
always wore a white waistcoat and smelt of
sherry when he kissed me, and my dear mother
died in Jubilee year—a very sad year, notwithstanding
the universal illuminations and rejoicings,
for me; so to Muriel I have always carried
all my troubles and griefs, and no better sister
for that sort of work could any man wish for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Particularly has she always been the sympathetic
recipient of my love-affairs, with the
single exception of my affair with Lucy; for
though Muriel isn’t in the least a snob, yet I
don’t suppose she would have been best pleased
to learn of her only brother’s attachment to an
innkeeper’s daughter, of however old a family.
So all she knew was that the Mabel Harker
business was at an end, and was naturally wondering
how my vagrant heart was being employed
meantime; questions on which subject, however,
I had always managed to shirk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly we were alone in the Medworth Square
morning-room, she opened fire on me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frank has been asking what has become of
you lately, Vincent,” she said—“what have you
been doing with yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been seeing a good deal of some Americans
at the ‘Victoria,’ and a good deal in and out
of town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of any importance. How’s Mollie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can go and see Mollie afterwards. Now,
look here, Vincent, you’re up to something, and I
mean to know what it is. I can’t have my only
brother drifting into a scrape, without doing my
best to keep him out of it. You’d better make
a clean breast. I shall be sure to find out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’d half a mind to tell her a downright fib and
stop her importunities that way; but I’d the instinct
she knew something of the fact, and was
well aware that, if she weren’t told all, would
set her prig of a husband to work; and then
our enterprise would as likely as not be nipped
in the bud by being made public property.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, on the whole, I judged it best to tell her
exactly what we were doing and were going to
do, taking care only to bind her over to the completest
secrecy, which, once she had given her
word, I knew she would die sooner than break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was half amused, half frightened, and at
first wholly incredulous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who on earth have you found to join
you in such a cracked scheme?” she asked. “I
didn’t know you’d so many desperate lunatics
among your acquaintances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, there’s Arthur Masters and Bob Hines,
to begin with; you know them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I know Mr. Hines, do I?
Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he was at Marlborough with me, and
now keeps a boys’ school at Folkestone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A nice instructor of youth, to go on an
expedition of this kind,” laughed my sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s exactly what he’s afraid of; he says
if he’s caught, it’ll be the end of his business
and he’ll have to break stones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why does he go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, he’s very much in want of a
gymnasium for his boys, and I’ve promised to
build him one out of the swag, if he’ll join us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tempted and fallen!” said my sister.
“Really, Vincent, you’re a Mephistopheles.
And who else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harold Forsyth, of the Devon Borderers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the little man who always looks as if
he was bursting out of his clothes with overeating?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought he was engaged to be married.
What’s the young lady about, to let him go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the fact is,” said I, “the young lady
turns out to be a wrong un, and is now chasing
him about with a writ for breach of promise in
her glove, like a cab-fare.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So he’s off to escape that?” said my sister.
“You’re a nice lot. Any one else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy Parsons, in my militia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a poor creature,” my sister observed.
“I shouldn’t take him; why, all he can do is
play the banjo and walk about Southport in
breeches and gaiters!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but he’s an old friend, and I want to do
him a good turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve odd notions of doing people a good
turn,” Muriel laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fact is,” I said, “he’s rather in a hole
about a bill of his that’s coming due. He’s gone
shares with one of our fellows in the regiment
in a steeple-chaser and given him a bill to meet
the expenses of training and the purchase; and
as the bill’s coming due and he’s mortally afraid
of his father—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You undertake to meet the bill, on the condition
he joins you. I see. And has that been
the best you can do? Who’s the sixth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brentin, who’s bought the yacht; the
American at the ‘Victoria.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all I can say is,” said my sister, after
a pause, “you’re rather a lame crew. Why,
Teddy Parsons alone is enough to ruin anything!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know,” I groaned, “but what is one
to do? I’ve been all over the country seeing
men, but they’re all much too frightened. We’re
an utterly scratch lot, I know, but Brentin and I
must do the best we can with the material and
trust to luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you most certainly will have to do,”
said my sister, with conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why can’t you come with us,” I urged, “and
be the mascot of the party? We must have
some one of the kind, if only to chaperon Miss
Rybot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me, who’s Miss Rybot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arthur Masters’s young woman, without whom
he won’t stir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now my sister Muriel is like a good many other
highly respectable Englishwomen: she is a most
faithful wife and devoted mother, but she doesn’t
care in any particular degree about her husband,
and is only too glad to welcome anything in the
way of honest excitement, if only to break the
monotony of home life. And here was excitement
for her, indeed, and, properly regarded, of
the most irreproachably honest description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It flattered, too, her love of adventure, for which
she had never had much outlet in Medworth
Square. Where we Blackers get our love of adventure
from, by-the-way, I don’t quite know,
unless it be from my mother’s father, who fought
at Waterloo, and died a very old gentleman, a
Knight of Windsor; but we certainly both of us
have it very strongly, as all good English people
should.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To cut a long story short, for I must really be
getting on, my sister finally agreed to come, if
only as chaperon to Miss Rybot. Like the rest
of us, she had never been to Monte Carlo, having
been hitherto forbidden by her husband; but now
she said she would insist, and allege as a reason
the necessity of her presence for keeping her only
brother from ruining himself at the tables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I was delighted to hear of her plucky resolve,
particularly as it at once got rid of the difficulty
of Miss Rybot’s chaperon—since Brentin
had made up his mind not to take his wife, but
send her down to Rochester while he was away,
and keep her fully employed there, in Charles
Dickens’s country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I kissed my sister, promising to come back to
dinner, and meantime went up in the nursery,
where I found my niece Mollie seated by the fire,
wrapped in a grimy little shawl, reading Grimm’s
<span class='it'>Fairy Tales</span>.</p>

<div class='summary'>
MR. BRENTIN’S INDISCRETION—LUCY AND I MAKE IT UP—BAILEY
THOMPSON APPEARS IN CHURCH—ON CHRISTMAS
DAY WE HOLD A COUNCIL OF WAR
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Now</span> it was the very day we went down to
“The French Horn” together that Mr. Brentin
confessed to me how, in spite of our agreement
as to keeping the affair a profound secret,
he had actually been so rash as to confide our
whole plan to a stranger—a stranger casually encountered,
above all places, in the smoking-room
of the “Victoria”!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How incomprehensible, how weak and wavering
is man! Here was Julius C. Brentin, as
shrewd an American as can be met with in Low’s
Exchange, deliberately pouring into a strange
ear a secret he had hitherto rigidly guarded even
from his young and attractive wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course he had his excuses and defence;
what man has not, when he does wrong? But
whatever the excuse, there still remained the unpleasant
fact that there was positively a man
walking about (and from his description one
evidently not quite a gentleman) who knew all
about our arrangements and could at any moment
communicate them to the authorities at Monte
Carlo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I asked him, somewhat sharply, how ever
he had come to commit so gross a blunder, he
had really no explanation to give. He seemed
to think he had sufficiently safeguarded himself
by exchanging cards with the man, than which I
could not conceive anything more childish—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'><span class='it'>MR. BAILEY THOMPSON</span></p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>without an address or a club on it! What possible
guarantee was there in that? Brentin himself
couldn’t quite say; only he seemed to fancy
the possession of his card gave him some sort of
hold on the owner, and that so long as he had it
in his keeping we were safe against treachery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How totally wrong he was, and how nearly his
absurd confidence came to absolutely ruining us
all, will clearly appear as this work goes on and
readers are taken to Monte Carlo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, as I continued to reproach him, he
took refuge in saying, “Well, it’s done, and
there’s an end to it; give over talking through
your hat!” A vulgar Americanism which much
offended me, and caused us to drive up to “The
French Horn” in somewhat sulky silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the 23d of December, and we found Mr.
Thatcher ready for us. I at once left him to
show Brentin over the house, the great hall decorated
with holly and cotton-wool mottoes, and
to his room, while I went in immediate search
of Lucy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over that tender meeting I draw the sacred
veil of reticence. The dear girl was soon in my
arms, soft and palpitating, full of forgiveness
and love. We spent the afternoon together in
a long walk across the links and down to the
coast-guards’ cottages, where we had tea; returning
only in time for dinner, through the
dark and starry evening of that singularly mild
December.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of our walk was that we made up
our minds to be married shortly before Easter—so
soon, in fact, as I could get back from abroad and
settle my affairs. About Monte Carlo, I told
her nothing further than that my sister was not
well, and I had undertaken to escort her there,
and see after her for a time—a fib, which, knowing
Lucy’s apprehensive nature, I judged to be
necessary, and for which I trust one day to be
forgiven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin and I dined together, partly in
silence, partly snapping at each other. On
Christmas Eve our party was complete, with the
exception of Harold Forsyth, who came over next
morning from Colchester. On Christmas Day,
“What’s the matter with our all going to
Church?” said Mr. Brentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing particularly the matter,” Bob Hines
replied, rather gruffly, “except that some of us
are probably unaccustomed to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Brentin insisted, and to Church,
accordingly, we all went, as meek as bleating
lambs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in the Wharton Park pew was sitting
Mr. Crage. The pew is so sheltered with its
high partition and curtain-rods, I didn’t see him
till he stood up; nor did I know there was any
one else there till the parson glared down
straight into the pew from the clerk’s ancient
seat under the pulpit, whence he read the lessons,
and said he really must beg chance members
of the congregation to observe the proper
reverential attitude, and not be continually
seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon a deep voice replied, amid considerable
sensation, from the bowels of the pew,
“Sir, you are in error. I always rise as the rubric
directs, but having no advantage of height—”
the rest of the speech being lost in the irreverent
titters of our party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brentin, who was next the pew, looked over
the partition and added to the sensation by
audibly observing, “Sakes alive! It’s friend
Bailey Thompson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the service was over and we all got outside,
he whispered, “Wait a minute, Blacker;
send the others on, and I’ll present you to my
friend.” So the others went on back to “The
French Horn,” while I remained behind with
some apprehension and curiosity to take this
Mr. Bailey Thompson’s measure. He came out
alone, Mr. Crage remaining to have a few words
with the parson (with whom he was continually
squabbling), and Brentin and Bailey Thompson
greeted each other with great warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned out to be a short, dark, determined-looking
little man, with a square chin and old-fashioned,
black, mutton-chop whiskers. No,
he was clearly not quite a gentleman, in the
sense that he had evidently never been at a
public school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” said Mr. Brentin as he presented me,
“is the originator of the little scheme I was telling
you of—Mr. Vincent Blacker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, indeed!” Mr. Bailey Thompson replied,
looking me full in the face with his penetrating
black eyes, and politely lifting his small,
tall hat. “Oh, indeed! so you really meant
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meant it?” echoed Brentin. “Why, the band
of brothers is here; they were in the pew next
you. Mr. Bailey Thompson, we are all here together
for the making of our final arrangements,
and in two weeks we start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, indeed!” he smiled; “it’s a bold piece of
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, it is colossal, but it will succeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us hope so. I am sure I wish you every
success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Bailey Thompson,” said Brentin, evidently
nettled at the way the little man continued
incredulously to smile, “if you care to join
us some time during the afternoon we shall be
glad to lay details of our plan before you. They
will not only prove our <span class='it'>bona-fides</span>, but show how
complete and fully thought out all our preparations
are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can leave my friend Crage towards four
o’clock, I will,” Mr. Thompson replied. “I know
Monte Carlo as well as most men, and may be
able to give you some useful hints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall be glad to see you, for none of us
have ever been there. But not a word to your
friend!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a word to a soul!” smiled the imperturbable
little man; and he left us to join the abandoned
Crage, who was still inside the sacred edifice
snarling at the parson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite useless saying anything further to
Brentin. I merely contented myself with pointing
out that if anything could make me suspect
Mr. Bailey Thompson, it was his being the guest
of Mr. Crage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pawsibly!” drawled Mr. Brentin. “I don’t
pretend the man is pure-bred, nor exactly fit at
this moment to take his seat at Queen Victoria’s
table; but that he’s stanch, with that square
chin, I will stake my bottom dollar. And seeing
how well he knows the locality, we shall learn
something from him, sir, which, you may depend
upon, will be highly useful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attitude of the band of brothers so far had
been rather of the negative order. Whether their
enthusiasm was cooling, as they had been employing
their spare time in pitifully surveying
the difficulties and danger of the scheme, instead
of the glory and the profit, I know not; but,
obviously, neither on Christmas Eve nor Christmas
morning were they any longer in the hopeful
condition in which they were when I first
approached and secured them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That they had been talking the matter over
among themselves was clear, for no sooner was
the Christmas fare disposed of in the great hall
than they began to open fire. Their first shot
was discharged when Mr. Thatcher brought us
in a bowl of punch, about three o’clock, and
Brentin proceeded to charge their glasses, and
desire them to drink to the affair and our successful
return therefrom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drank the toast so half-heartedly, much
as Jacobites when called on to pledge King
George, that Brentin lost his temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen!” he cried, thumping the table,
“if you cannot drink to our success with more
<span class='it'>momentum</span> than that, you will never do for adventurers;
you may as well stay right here and
till the soil. And that’s all there is to it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with eating fat bacon
under a hedge?” growled Bob Hines. He had
been much nettled at the way Brentin had taken
us all in charge, and more particularly at his
being ordered off to church. Hence his not
altogether apposite interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brentin fixed him with his glittering, beady
eyes. “Mr. Hines,” he said, “if you are the
spokesman of the malecontents, I am perfectly
ready to hear what you have to object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very good,” Hines replied, stiffly,
“but I imagined the scheme was Blacker’s, and
not yours at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The scheme is the scheme,” said Brentin,
impatiently. “Neither one man’s nor another’s.
Either you go in with us or you do not; now,
then, take your choice, right here and now.
You know all about it, what we are going to do
and how we are going to do it. There are no
flies on the scheme, any more than there are on
us. We don’t care ay ginger-snap whether you
withdraw or not; but at least we have the right
to know which course you intend to pursue.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The difficulty appears to me,” Forsyth struck
in, in conciliatory tones, “that none of us have
ever been to the place, so that we can’t really
tell whether the thing is possible or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly!” murmured Teddy Parsons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brentin gave a gesture of vexation. “Monte
Carlo has, of course, been thoroughly surveyed
before this determination of ours has been arrived
at—from a distance, ay considerable distance, I
admit. Still, it has been surveyed, though, naturally,
through other parties’ eyes. Every authority
we have consulted agrees that the thing is
perfectly feasible; every one, without exception,
wonders why it has never been done before;
every one admits it is a plague-spot which should
be cauterized. Shall we do it? Yes or no?
There is the whole thing in ay nutshell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy Parsons observed, “There is one thing
I should like to know, and that is—er—will there
be any bloodshed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless they shed it,” was Brentin’s somewhat
grim reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy shuddered and went on, “But I understand
we are actually to be armed with revolvers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so,” said Brentin, “but they will not
be loaded, or with blank cartridge at the most.
Experience tells us that gentlemen are just as
badly frightened by an unloaded as by a loaded
gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Arthur Masters struck in, “I suppose
there will be likely to be a good deal of hustling
and possibly violence before we can count on
getting clear away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t apprehend,” said Brentin, “there
will be much of either; though, of course, we
can’t expect the affair will pass off quite so
quietly as an ordinary social lunch-party. We
may, for instance, have to knock a few people
down. Surely English gentlemen are not afraid
of having to do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not a question of fear,” Masters haughtily
replied. “I’m not thinking of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear! Hear!” cried that snipe Parsons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thinking of the ladies of our party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a very pretty girl here,” Parsons
ventured. “I wish she could be persuaded—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forsyth nudged him, while I cried “Order!”
savagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be ladies in our party,” Masters
went on. “It would be a terrible thing if they
were to be frightened or in any way injured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I yield to no man,” declaimed Brentin, “in
my chivalrous respect for the sex. But there
are certain places and times when the presence
of ladies is highly undesirable. The Casino
rooms at Monte Carlo, when we are about to
raid them, is one. That’s the reason which has
determined me to leave Mrs. Brentin behind, in
complete ignorance of what we are about to do.
I do not presume to dictate to other gentlemen
what their course of action should be, but I must
say our chances of success will be enormously
magnified if no ladies are permitted to be of the
party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear! Hear!” murmured Hines, who from
a certain gruffness of manner is no particular
favorite with the sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it would be enough,” urged Masters,
“if, on the actual day of our attempt, the ladies
of our party undertook not to go into the rooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it would,” Brentin replied, “but
for myself I should prefer they remained altogether
in England, offering up a series of succinct
and heartfelt prayers for our safe return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob Hines gave a snort of laughter, whereupon
Brentin fixed him inquiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Englishwomen have prayed for the safe return
of heroes before now, Mr. Hines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am aware of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why gurgle at the back of your throat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a certain irrepressible sense of humor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is remarkable for an Englishman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether Mr. Brentin were deliberately bent
on rubbing us all up the wrong way, I don’t
know, but he was most certainly doing it, so I
thought it judicious to interpose. It was just at
that moment Mr. Bailey Thompson stepped into
the room.</p>

<div class="chapter">

</div>

<div class='summary'>
MR. BAILEY THOMPSON GIVES US HIS INGENIOUS ADVICE—WE
ARE FOOLS ENOUGH TO TRUST HIM—MISPLACED
CONFIDENCE
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>The</span> very man!” cried Brentin. “Mr. Bailey
Thompson, let me present you to my friends.
You are just in time to give them assurance of
the feasibility of the great scheme you and I have
already had some discussion over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Bailey Thompson’s name had been cursorily
mentioned during dinner as that of a gentleman
who might look in in the course of the afternoon,
and, if he came, would be able to give
us some useful hints; but, beyond that, Brentin
had kept him back as a final card, having already
some notion of the wavering going on, and desiring
to use him to clinch the business one way or
the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thompson bowed and smiled, and Brentin
went on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is some dissatisfaction in the camp,
sir; there is some doubt and there is fear. Advice
is badly needed. I look to you to give it
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be very glad to be of any use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let me present you, Mr. Thompson.
This powerful young man with the leonine head
and cherry-wood pipe is Mr. Hines; next him,
with the slight frame, tawny mustache, and
Richmond Gem cigarette, is Mr. Parsons; opposite,
with the clean, clear, and agreeable countenance
and the cigar, is Mr. Forsyth; next him,
with the sloping brow and thoughtful back to his
head, is Mr. Masters, who doesn’t smoke. Vincent
Blacker you know. Gentlemen, Mr. Bailey
Thompson. There is your glass, sir; drink, and
when you feel sufficiently stimulated and communicative,
speak!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thompson darted his penetrating eyes over
the company, smiled again, and took his glass of
tepid punch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you really mean it,” he said, sitting between
us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin groaned. “Don’t let us hear that
from you again, sir,” he said; “it is likely to
breed bad blood. Take it from me, we really
mean it, and only need advice how it should best
be done. Mr. Bailey Thompson, we are all attention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the first place, then,” the little man remarked,
amid dead silence, as he sipped his
punch, “let me say you have, in my judgment,
enormously underestimated the amount of money
in the rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the place well, and speak with some
authority.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what we want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, there are nine roulette and four trente-et-quarante
tables. Each, I am told, is furnished
with £4000 to begin play on for the day; total,
£52,000.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mark this, gentlemen!” cried the agitated
Brentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But each table wins per diem, roughly speaking,
about £400; so that, if you select, say, ten
o’clock in the evening for your attempt, you may
count on £5200 more—total, say, £58,000.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make a note, gentlemen,” said Brentin,
“that we select ten-thirty, to make sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That does not take into account the money
lying there already staked by the players, which
you may calculate as fully £3000 more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, go slow, Mr. Bailey Thompson, sir, go
slow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where your underestimation is most
marked,” said the impressive little man, sweeping
his eyes round the attentive circle, “is in
calculating the reserve in the vaults. In short,
I have no hesitation in saying that, taking everything
into consideration, there must be at least
half a million of money lying in the Casino
premises, at—the—very—least!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the dead silence, broken only by the taking
in of breath, I could hear Lucy playing the
piano down-stairs in the little room behind the
bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thompson sipped his punch again and
looked at us calmly over the rim of his tumbler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think the money in the vaults is
as easily got at as the rest?” Bob Hines asked,
in a constrained voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I shouldn’t like to say,” Thompson
cautiously replied. “I can tell you, however,
that I have myself twice seen the bank broken;
which only means, by-the-way, that the £4000 at
that particular table had been won.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play at that table was merely suspended
while a further supply was being fetched from
the vaults.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where are the vaults?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Below the building somewhere, but precisely
where I cannot tell you; but I have no doubt,
once the rooms are in your possession, and, given
the time, you would have no difficulty whatever
in breaking into them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impressive silence again, broken at last by
Brentin. “And now, sir, will you be good
enough to give us some idea of the amount of
opposition we are likely to meet with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bailey Thompson looked meditative, and, after
a pause, proceeded. “Outside the building, at
every twenty paces or so, you will find men stationed.
They are merely firemen, whose chief
duty it is to see no bomb is thrown into the
rooms or deposited outside by the anarchists,
who have frequently threatened it. They are
not soldiers, and are not in any way armed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy Parsons breathed heavily and murmured,
“Capital!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what force is there inside?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are a great number of men about, attendants
and so forth, but I cannot conceive
them capable of any resistance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t imagine they are secretly armed?”
asked the palpitating Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me, no, any more than the attendants
at an ordinary club!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short,” said Mr. Brentin, “you feel
pretty confident that neither inside nor outside
we are likely to encounter a single weapon of
offence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly confident. Perfectly confident,
gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about the army?” Parsons asked.
“I understand the Prince of Monaco has an army
of seventy men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite correct,” Bailey Thompson replied,
“but it is stationed up in Monaco, at least a
mile away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it would be some time before they
could be mustered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides,” Mr. Brentin dryly observed, “they
are not likely to be of much use unless they
can swim. We propose to escape on board the
<span class='it'>Amaranth</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s your best chance, gentlemen,” said Mr.
Thompson—“in fact, your only practicable one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you think six of us are enough for the
business?” asked Masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be the best judges of that, perhaps,
when you see the place. My own feeling is that,
to make it all perfectly safe, you should be at
least a dozen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If necessary,” said Mr. Brentin, “we can
always impress half a dozen of our crew. Nothing
like a jolly Jack-tar for a job of this kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you do,” smiled Bailey Thompson, “you
will have to fig them out in what they call <span class='it'>tenue
de ville convenable</span>. They won’t let them into
the rooms in their common sailor dress. Why,
gentlemen, they refused me admission once because
my boots were dusty. Clean hands don’t
so much matter,” he added, in his sly fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he rose and remarked, “I must now be
returning to Wharton; my poor old friend Crage
is in low spirits, and I have undertaken not to
be more than half an hour away from him. If
there is any further information wanted, however—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this,” said Hines; “taking it at its
worst, and supposing we are all, or any of us, captured,
what do you imagine will be our fate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Thompson shrugged his shoulders. “You
will be treated with every courtesy; you will undoubtedly
be tried, but—if only from the fact of
your failing—you will, I should think, be let off
easily. If you succeed, and all of you get clear
away, I do not imagine there will be any serious
pursuit, for policy will close the authorities’
mouth; they will not care to advertise to the
world how easily the place can be looted. In
fact, from what I know of them, they will most
likely take particular pains to deny it has ever
been done at all. You see, gentlemen, the entire
Continental press is in their pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is, no doubt, a criminal court and a
prison at Monaco?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes; and if, unfortunately, you are caught,
you will all be sentenced for life, I imagine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t call that being let off easy,” grunted
Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not in theory, but in practice, yes;
for in a year or so you will find yourselves free to
stroll about the town, and even down to Monte
Carlo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In fact, bolt?” said Masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly; more especially if your relatives pay
due attention to the jailers and see they want
for nothing. In conclusion, gentlemen, I drink
to your enterprise, and wish you all well through
it. <span class='it'>Au revoir!</span>” And with a courteous bow and
wave of his gloved hand (he wore dogskin gloves
the whole time), Mr. Bailey Thompson, accompanied
by the jubilant Brentin, withdrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, “what do you say now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a brief silence, and then Teddy Parsons
observed, “It seems to me we may as well go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a million of money!” murmured Forsyth,
meditatively, “and most of it for hospitals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, out of <span class='it'>that</span>, you might manage to
stand me a swimming-bath as well as a gymnasium,
eh?” whispered Bob Hines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin returned to us radiant. “Well,
gentlemen, what do you think of it all now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are coming,” I ventured to say, and the
band of brothers nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, I say!” spluttered Masters, who had for
the most part kept silent—“who is Mr. Bailey
Thompson? Who knows anything about him?
Who can guarantee he won’t give us away to the
Monte Carlo people, and have us all quodded before
we can even get a look in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin frowned. “I will answer for Mr.
Thompson with my life!” he cried. “He is a
gentleman of the most royal integrity. I have
studied him in every social relation, and I never
knew him fail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, that’ll do,” interrupted Bob Hines,
who had all along shown some impatience at
Brentin’s long speeches. “We only want to
know somebody is responsible for his not selling
us, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A responsibility Mr. Brentin undertook with
the greatest cheerfulness and readiness, and that,
mind you, for a man who turned out to be Scotland
Yard personified—who, but for his inane
jealousy of the French police and his desire
to effect our capture single-handed, would have
been the means of casting five highly strung English
gentlemen, and one excitable American, into
lifelong chains; and who, on the very morning
after his interview with us (as he afterwards
confessed to me), was actually at Whitehall concerting
plans with the authorities there how best
to catch us <span class='it'>in flagrante delicto</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How, on the contrary, we caught <span class='it'>him</span>, and had
him deported to the southernmost point of Greece,
forms one of my choicest memories, and will now
soon be related at sufficient length.</p>

<div class='summary'>
MONTE CARLO—MR. VAN GINKEL’S YACHT <span class='it'>SARATOGA</span>—WE
PROSPECT—FORTUNATE DISCOVERY OF THE POINT OF
ATTACK—FIRST VISIT TO THE ROOMS
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a brilliant January day, mild and sunny,
when Mr. Brentin, Parsons, and I were standing
in the old bastion on the point of Monaco, straining
our gaze for a glimpse of the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>. In
front stretched the flickering, shifting pavement
of the Mediterranean, of a deep, smooth sapphire,
ruffled here and there, as the nap of a hat
brushed the wrong way. Nothing to be seen on
it but the one loose white sail of a yacht drifting
out of harbor past the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had strolled up the long ramp from the
Condamine and through the gateway leading to
the old bastions, chiefly to see whether they were
provided with guns; we were relieved to find
they were not—mere peaceable flower-walks, in
fact, and already blossoming with geranium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the unfinished cathedral behind us in the
old town, crushed and huddled together like a
Yorkshire fishing village, came the rolling throb
of the heavy mid-day bell; up from the harbor
far below, the smart bugle-call of a French corvette.
Little figures in white ran about the deck,
and the tricolor fluttered from the peak. Close
alongside her lay an American yacht, the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>,
belonging to Mr. Van Ginkel, a former
friend of Mr. Brentin’s. Both the vessels caused
us a considerable amount of uneasiness; the corvette
carried guns, the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span> was noted for
her speed. It was quite uncertain how long they
might continue to grace the harbor. One could
easily blow us out of the water; the other could
just as easily give us an hour’s start, take fifty
men on board, pursue, overhaul, and bring us
back, flushed though in other respects we might
be with victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had already been three days in Monte
Carlo, and so far there had been no sign of their
departure. “If the worst comes,” said Mr.
Brentin, “we must take Van Ginkel into our
confidence and indooce him to take a trip over
to San Remo on the night of our attempt. The
mischief is, I am so little of his acquaintance
now I hesitate to ask so great a favor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of man is he?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, we were classmates at Harvard in
’60. Since then, though full of good-will, we
have scarcely met. I understand, however, he
has some stomach trouble, and is ay considerable
invalid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Married?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Di-vorced. Mrs. Van Ginkel is now the
Princess Danleno, of Rome, a widow of large
wealth. She owns the Villa Camellia at Cannes,
and is over here constantly, in the season, they
tell me. She plays heavily on a highly ingenious
and complicated system of her own, which costs
her about as much as the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span> costs her former
husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had taken up our abode at the “Hôtel Monopôle”—a
hotel recommended to us by Mr. Bailey
Thompson, by-the-way, for purposes of his own.
It is a quiet little house, up the hill, and not far
from the “Victoria”; there we had safely arrived
three days before—Parsons, Brentin, Bob Hines,
and I. Forsyth, Masters, my sister Mrs. Rivers,
and Miss Rybot had embarked in the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>
from Portsmouth a few days before we left
London, and were now about due at Monte Carlo.
My brother-in-law, the publisher, had made no
difficulty to my sister’s joining the expedition,
as to the true object of which he of course knew
nothing; in fact, he was delighted she could get
a holiday on the Riviera so cheaply. It was understood
she was not to play, and not to spend
more than £10 <span class='it'>en route</span>. I heard afterwards
that Paternoster Row simply ran with his brag.
“I’m a bachelor just at present. My wife’s
yachting in the Mediterranean with some rich
Americans. Very hospitable people; they wanted
me to come, but really, just now—” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had spent our first three days, not unprofitably,
in prospecting the place. We reached
Monte Carlo in the afternoon, and at once drove
up to the hotel. Almost the first thing we saw
was a large board over a little house on the hillside,
close by the Crédit Lyonnais, with “<span class='it'>Avances
sur bijoux</span>” on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brentin chuckled. “Well, gentlemen,” he
said, “we sha’n’t play the game quite so low
down as that, eh? It will be either neck or
nothing with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was five o’clock before we started to go down
to the Casino. We set out in solemn silence,
down the steep and glaring white road, past the
“Victoria” and the chemist’s. At the head of
the gaudy, painted gardens, that look like the supreme
effort of a <span class='it'>modiste</span>, we came in full view
of the rooms. There we paused, choked, the
most sensitive of us, by our emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front there was a long strip of gay flower-beds
and white pebble paths, flanked by rows of
California palms. To my excited fancy they were
the planted feather brooms of <span class='it'>valets-de-place</span>—moral
<span class='it'>valets-de-place</span> who had set out to sweep the
place clean but had never had the courage to go
further. To the right of us were the hotels—the
“St. James’s” and the “De Paris”; to the left,
the Casino gardens again, and the shallow pools
where the frogs croak so dolorously at nightfall.
They are, I believe (for I am a Pythagorean), the
souls of ruined gamblers, still croaking out their
<span class='it'>quatre premier</span>, their <span class='it'>dix-quinze</span>, their <span class='it'>douze dernier</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace, batrachians!” I cried to them one
evening, in the exalted mood that now became
common to me. “Be still, hoarse souls! push
no more shadowy stakes upon a board of shadows
with your webbed fingers. We are here to avenge
ye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we went on down to the front of the
rooms. There, unable to find a seat, we leaned
against a lamp-post and gloated on the fantastic
building that held our future possessions. On
our left was the Café de Paris, overflowing with
<span class='it'>consommateurs</span> at little tables under the awning;
from the swirling whirlpool of noise made by the
Hungarian band issued a maimed but recognizable
English comic air. The sun was just setting
in a matchless sky of Eton blue; the breeze had
dropped, and the dingy Monaco flag over the
Casino hung inert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soldiers!” whispered Teddy, giving me a
frightened nudge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were, apparently, a couple of officers of
the prince’s army, strolling round, smoking cheap
cigars; they carried no side arms, and were of
no particular physique. “Besides,” I said, “they
are not allowed to enter the rooms. Don’t be so
nervous, Teddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go down on to the terrace,” murmured
Brentin, “and view the place from the back. We
must see how close we can get the yacht up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we went to the right, past the jingling omnibus
crawling up from the Condamine, down the
steps, and on to the terrace facing the sea. We
passed the firemen Bailey Thompson told us we
should find there, five or six of them; one at
every twenty paces, in uniform, with an odd sort
of gymnastic belt on. They were stationed at the
back, too, and clearly formed a complete protection
against any possible bomb-throwing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are too many of those men,” observed
Brentin, irritably. “We shall have to do something
to draw them off on our great night or
they’ll get in the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we went and looked over the balustrade
of the terrace. Below us ran the railway from
Monaco; on the other side of the line, connected
by an iron bridge with the Casino terrace, was
the pigeon-shooting club-house and grounds.
They formed a sort of bastion, jutting out into
the sea; the pale, wintry grass was still marked
with the traps of last year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>That</span> won’t do!” Brentin said, decisively, after
a few moments’ survey. “The run’s too far
over that bridge and down across the grass. Besides,
we should want rope ladders before we
could get down the wall. Come, gentlemen, let
us try this way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went to the extreme right of the terrace,
and there, miraculously enough, we found at
once the very thing we wanted. Mr. Brentin
merely pointed at it in silence, keeping his attitude
till we had all grasped the situation. It
was a rickety gate at the head of an evidently
unused flight of steps, leading down on to the
railway line below. Beside it stood a weather-worn
board with “<span class='it'>Défense d’entrée au public</span>” on
it. It looked singularly out of place amid all that
smart newness; but there it was, the very thing
we were in search of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The railway below ran six or eight feet above
the sea, without any protecting parapet to speak
of. Just at the angle where the pigeon-shooting
ground jutted out there was a sort of broken
space, where, for some reason (perhaps to allow
the employés to descend), rocks were piled up
from the shore. A boat could be there in waiting;
the yacht could lie thirty yards off; if we
had designed the place ourselves, we couldn’t
have done it better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Brentin slowly pointed a fateful finger
down the steps, across the line, to the corner
where the shore lay so close and handy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you observe it, gentlemen?” he whispered,
awe-struck—“do you take it all in? There
is no tide in the Mediterranean; the edge of the
sea will always be there. Even if the night turns
out as black as velvet we could find the boat
there blindfold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a solemn moment, broken only by the
jingle of omnibus bells. I felt like Wolfe when
he first spied the broken path that led up the cliff
face from the St. Lawrence to the Heights of
Abraham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By accident or design, Brentin gave Teddy
Parsons’s white Homburg hat a tilt with his elbow;
it tumbled off down the face of the terrace
and fell out of sight on to the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s your chance, Teddy,” I said. “Run
down the steps and fetch your hat. You can
see if there’s another gate at the bottom where
that bunch of cactus is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy came back breathless. “There’s no
sort of obstruction,” he gasped. “It’s a clear run
all the way. Only we shall have to be careful, if
the night’s dark; some of the steps are broken.”
Poor Teddy, how prophetic!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered the rooms for the first time after
dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Readers who have been to Monte Carlo will remember
that, before going into the hall, there is
a room on the left, where half a dozen men sit
writing cards of admission and drawing up lists
of visitors. They make no trouble about it, they
simply ask you your hotel and nationality—<span class='it'>Anglish,
hein?</span>—and hand you over a pink card,
good only for one day. Then you go to the right
and leave your stick. Neither stick nor umbrella
are allowed in the rooms. “Another point
in our favor,” as I whispered to Brentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Facing is the large hall; up and down stroll
gamblers, come out for a breath of air or the
whiff of a cigarette. Any one may use it, or the
concert-room on the right, or the reading-rooms
above, without a ticket; the ticket is needed
only for the gambling. You can even cash a
check or discount a bill there; for clerks are
in attendance from the different banking-houses,
within and without the principality, who will attend
to your wants as a loser or take charge of
your winnings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the left, heavy doors are constantly swinging.
You can hear, if you listen, as they swing,
the faint, enticing clink of the five-franc pieces
within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my friends,” murmured Brentin, as we
moved towards them, “support me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He presented his pink card with a low bow to
the two men guarding the entrance; we followed,
and the next minute were palpitating in the stifling
atmosphere of the last of the European public
infernos.</p>

MRS. WINGHAM AND TEDDY PARSONS—HE FOOLISHLY CONFIDES
IN HER—I MAKE A SIMILAR MISTAKE
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Now</span> there was staying at our hotel, among
other quiet people, a quiet old lady, whom, from
her accent and the way she occasionally stumbled
over an h, I took to be the widow of a well-to-do
tradesman, a suburban <span class='it'>bon marché</span>, or stores.
She played regularly every afternoon till dinner-time,
dressed in black, with a veil down just below
the tip of her nose, and worn black kid
gloves, staking mostly on the <span class='it'>pair</span> or <span class='it'>impair</span> at
roulette; and every evening she sat in the hotel
over a bit of wood-fire, reading either <span class='it'>Le Petit
Niçois</span> or an odd volume of <span class='it'>Sartor Resartus</span>,
which, with some ancient torn <span class='it'>Graphics</span>, formed
the library of the “Monopôle.” Her name I discovered
afterwards to be Mrs. Wingham.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was only the third evening after our arrival
that, going into the reading-room to write my
daily loving letter to Lucy, there I found Mrs.
Wingham and Teddy Parsons seated each side of
the fire, talking away as confidentially as if they
had known each other all their lives. Bob Hines,
who had taken to gambling and couldn’t be kept
away from the rooms, and Brentin had gone
down to the Casino.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few things I know more difficult than to write
a letter and at the same time listen to a conversation,
and I soon found myself writing down
scraps of Teddy’s inflated talk, working it, in
spite of myself, into my letter to Lucy—talk all
the more inflated as I had come into the room
quietly at his back, and he didn’t know I was
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was telling the old lady all about his father,
the colonel, and how he had fought through the
Crimea without a scratch. Yes, he was in the
army himself—at least, the auxiliary portion of
it: the second line. He lived most of the year at
Southport, when he wasn’t out with his regiment,
or hunting and shooting with friends, and
always came up to London for the Derby and
stayed in Duke Street. He was very fond of a
bit of racing, and, in fact, owned some race
horses—or, rather, “a chaser”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A what, sir?” asked the old woman, who
was listening to him with her mouth open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A chaser—a steeple-chaser, don’t you know—‘Tenderloin,’
which was entered for the Grand
National, and would be sure to be heavily backed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, he didn’t care much about gambling; a
man didn’t get a fair run for his money at Monte
Carlo, the bank reserved too many odds in their
own favor; to say nothing, as I knew, of his
being kept very short of pocket-money by the
colonel. And then he was actually fool enough
to say, with a self-satisfied laugh, that he’d a
notion the right way to treat the bank was to
raid it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raid it, sir?” cried the old woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, certainly, raid it; go into the rooms with
a pistol and shout ‘Hands up, everybody!’ and
carry off all the money on board a yacht, and be
off, full speed.” Did Mrs. Wingham know if it
had ever been tried?</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that to confiding our whole plan would
have been only one step; but just at that moment
in came Mrs. Sellars and Miss Marter, the only
two other English ladies in the hotel, and Teddy
and Mrs. Wingham fell to talking in whispers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sellars, who was a stout, comfortable-looking
person, with a large nose, a high color,
and an expansive figure, generally attired in a
blouse and a green velveteen skirt, was given to
walking up and down the reading-room, moaning
in theatrical agony over the disquieting news
from South Africa. If she didn’t get a letter from
her husband in the morning, she didn’t know
what she should do; it was weeks since she had
heard from him; something told her he was
dead—and so on. Every distressed turn she
took brought her nearer the ramshackle piano;
so at last Miss Marter, mainly to stop her (for
old maids don’t take much interest in other
women’s husbands, alive or dead), with some asperity
remarked, “Sing us something, dear; it
will calm you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she came to me and said, excitedly, “<span class='it'>Do</span>
you mind if I bring down my little dog? I always
ask, as people sometimes object. It is the
dearest little dog, and always sits in my lap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy gave a violent start when he heard me
answer, and knew he was detected. He got up,
and, pretending to hum, immediately left the
room. I didn’t like to follow at once, as I felt
inclined; it would look as though Mrs. Sellars’s
threatened singing drove me away. But the
moment she finished I meant to go and give the
wind-bag a good blowing-up, and meantime went
on with my letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Sellars hooted “ ’Tis I!” and “In the
Gloaming,” and was beginning “Twickenham
Ferry” when she broke down over the accompaniment,
rose, and came to the fire. Miss
Marter was sitting one side of it, stroking her
torpid little terrier, and Mrs. Wingham (who
was focussing <span class='it'>Sartor Resartus</span> through her glasses)
on the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, dear,” said Miss Marter. “I
hope you feel calmer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never be calmer,” Mrs. Sellars moaned,
“till George is home again at my side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dear,” Miss Marter maliciously replied,
looking down her long nose, “you know you insisted
on his going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I left the two ladies to squabble as to who
was mainly responsible for George’s being in
South Africa in such ticklish times, and went in
search of Teddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was neither in the <span class='it'>fumoir</span> nor his bedroom,
so down I went to the rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There I found Bob Hines punting on the middle
dozen and the last six at roulette, with a pile
of five-franc pieces before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those your winnings?” I whispered; to which
he gave the not over-polite reply, “How can you
be such a fool?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I knew he was losing, and went off in search
of Brentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found him in an excited circle watching a
common-looking Englishman at the <span class='it'>trente-et-quarante</span>
tables, who with great coolness was
staking the maximum of twelve thousand francs,
two at a time, one on <span class='it'>couleur</span> and one on black.
In front of him the notes were piled so high that,
being a little man, he had to press them down
with his elbows before he could use his rake.
Sometimes he won one bundle of notes, neatly
pinned together and representing the maximum;
sometimes both, as <span class='it'>couleur</span> and black turned out
alike. Rarely he lost both. Others were staking,
but mostly only paltry louis, or the broad, shining
five-louis pieces one only sees at Monte Carlo.
There was the usual church-like silence,
broken only by the dry, sharp tones of the croupier’s
harsh voice, “<span class='it'>Le jeu est fait!</span>” and then,
sharper still, “<span class='it'>Rien ne va plus!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once the tension was broken by a titter of
laughter, as a withered little Italian with a
frightened air threw a five-franc piece down on
the board and the croupier pushed it back. The
poor devil apparently didn’t know that gold only
may be staked at <span class='it'>trente-et-quarante</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I plucked Brentin by the sleeve and drew him
to a side seat against the wall. “I hope that
gentleman may be staking here this day week,”
he chuckled. “Notes are easy to carry, and I
myself have seen him win sixty thousand francs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he heard about Teddy he was furious.
It was all I could do to prevent him from going
off at once to the hotel and insisting on his leaving
Monte Carlo by the next train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I allow,” he said, “I was precipitate with
Bailey Thompson, but at least we drew something
out of him in the way of information. But to
confide in a blathering old woman, who has nothing
to do but eat and talk—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went back to the hotel, only to find Teddy’s
bedroom door locked, and to have my knocking
greeted with a loud, sham snore. Mrs. Wingham
I found still in the reading-room, alone, still focussing
<span class='it'>Sartor Resartus</span> with her shocked and
puzzled expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your friend has just gone up to bed,” she
remarked, “if you are looking for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I thanked her, and, sitting the other side of the
fire, proceeded to draw her out. She soon told
me Teddy was so like a nephew of hers she had
recently lost she had felt obliged to speak to
him. She noticed him at once, she said, the first
evening at dinner, and felt drawn to him immediately.
What a fine, manly young feller he was,
and how full of sperrit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, I said, he was, and often had very ingenious
ideas—for instance, that notion of his to
raid the tables I had overheard him discussing
with her. But, then, there was all the difference
in the world between having an idea and the
carrying it out, wasn’t there? Merely as a matter
of curiosity, what did she think of the notion—she,
who doubtless knew the place so well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artful old woman—Bailey Thompson’s sister,
if you please, and spy, as it afterwards turned
out; hence his recommending us the “Monopôle,”
so that she might keep an eye on us and report—the
artful old woman looked puzzled, as though
she were trying to remember what it was Teddy
had said on the subject. Then she began to
laugh. “Oh, I didn’t think much of that. Why,
look at all the people there are about! Why,
you’d need a ridgiment!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, will it be believed that I, who had just
been so righteously indignant with Parsons for
his talkative folly, did myself (feeling uncommonly
piqued at her scornful tone) immediately
set out to prove to her the thing was perfectly
possible, and then and there explain in detail
how it could all be successfully done, and with
how small a force. I did, indeed, so true as I am
sitting writing here now, in our flat in Victoria
Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wingham listened to me attentively,
laughing to herself and saying, “Dear! dear!
so it might!” as she rubbed her knuckled old
hands between her black silk knees. When I had
done, I felt so vexed with myself I could have
bitten my tongue out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rose, however, and, observing, “Of course, it
is an idea and nothing else, and never will be
realized,” bade her good-night and left the room,
feeling uncommonly weak and foolish. She murmured,
“Oh, of course!” as I closed the noisy
glass door behind me and went up-stairs to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few minutes later, remembering I had left
my book on the table where I had been writing
to Lucy, I went down-stairs again to fetch it.
Mrs. Wingham was still there, sitting at the table
writing a letter. The envelope, already written,
was lying close by my book, and I couldn’t help
reading it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was positively addressed to “Jas. B. Thompson,
Esq., 3 Aldrich Road Villas, Brixton Rise,
S. E. London.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt so faint I could scarcely get out of the
room again and up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But such is our insane confidence, where we ourselves
and our own doings are concerned—such, at
any rate, was mine in my lucky star—that I really
felt no difficulty in persuading myself the
whole thing was merely a coincidence, and that
the writing of the letter had nothing whatever
to do with either my or Teddy Parsons’s divulgations;
more especially as the Bailey, on which
Thompson evidently piqued himself, was omitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And I determined to say nothing about it to
Brentin, partly because I didn’t care about being
blackguarded by an American, and partly because
I felt convinced it was all an accident,
and nothing would come of it. Nor, in my
generosity, did I do more to Teddy Parsons
than temperately point out the folly he had
been guilty of, and beg him to be more careful
in future, which he very cheerfully promised,
and for which magnanimity of mine he was,
as I meant he should be, really uncommonly
grateful.</p>

ARRIVAL OF THE <span class='it'>AMARANTH</span>—ALL WELL ON BOARD—THEIR
FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE ROOMS
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> next afternoon, soon after four, the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>
arrived in harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob Hines was gambling, as usual, but Brentin,
Teddy, and I went down to the Condamine to
meet them. Teddy and Brentin had had their
row out in the morning, to which I had listened
in silence—with the indulgent air of a man who
doesn’t want to add to the unpleasantness—and
now were pretty good friends again. It was
clearly understood, however, that no new acquaintances
were to be made, male or female,
and that henceforth any one of us seen talking
to a stranger was immediately to be sent home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I fear the party from the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span> did not
have a very good impression of Monte Carlo to begin
with, for they landed in the Condamine, just
where the town drain-pipes lie, and came ashore,
each of them, with a handkerchief to the nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is the Riviera!” snuffled my good
sister. “I understood it was embosomed in
flowers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all looked very brown and well, and
seemed in high spirits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the yacht, she had behaved splendidly
all through, and the conduct and polite attentions
of Captain Evans and the crew had been
above all praise. The only difficulty had been
to explain away the shell and the three cannon;
for which Forsyth had found the ingenious excuse
that they were wanted for the Riff pirates,
in case we determined to voyage along the African
coast, where they are said to abound and
will sometimes attack a yacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all strolled up the hill together, and, such
were their spirits, nothing would content the
new arrivals but an immediate visit to the rooms.
Miss Rybot, especially, was as cheerful as a
blackbird in April; she had come there to gamble,
she said, and gamble she would at once.
She and Masters were evidently on the best of
terms, and even the captious Brentin was pleased
with what people who write books call her “infectious
gayety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your own little schemes,” she
cried, “and I have mine. I am going to win
fifty pounds to pay my debts with, and then I
am going home, whether you have finished or
not. And if I haven’t finished, you will all have
to leave me here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were soon provided with their pink admission-cards
(ours had that morning, after the
usual pretended scrutiny and demur, been exchanged
for white monthly ones), and, after leaving
their cloaks, passed through the swing-doors
into the rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was just that impressive hour—the only
one, I think, at Monte Carlo—when the Casino
footmen, in their ill-fitting liveries, zigzagged
with faded braid, bring in the yellow oil-lamps
with hanging green shades, and sling them from
the long brass chains over the tables. The rest
of the rooms lie in twilight, before the electric
light is turned up. Dim figures sweep noiselessly
as spectres over the dull-shining parquet
floor, and, like a spear, I have seen the last long
ray of southern sunshine strike in and touch
the ghastly hollow cheek of some old woman
fingering her coins, lifeless and mechanical as
Charon fingering his passage-money for the
dead; but, just over the tables, the yellow light
from the lamp falls brilliant, yet softly, brightly
illuminating the gamblers’ hands and some few
of their faces, throwing the white numbers on
the rich green cloth as strongly into relief as
though newly sewn on there of tape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Faites votre jeu, messieurs!</span>” croaks the
croupier, in his dry, toneless voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With deft fingers he spins the active, rattling
little ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Le jeu est fait!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white ball begins to tire, drops out of its
circuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Rien ne va plus!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few seconds of leaping indecision and restlessness,
before the ball falls finally into a number
and remains there, while the board still
spins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Trente-six!—Rouge, pair et manque!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The croupiers’ rakes are busy, pulling in the
money lost; the money won is thrown with dull,
heavy thuds and clinks on to the table. In a
few moments it is begun all over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Faites votre jeu, messieurs!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is Monte Carlo!” whispered my sister,
in the proper, hushed tones, as though asking
me for something to put in the collection.
“My one objection is, no one looks in the least
haggard or anxious. I understood I should see
such terrible faces, and they all look as bored
as people at an ordinary London dinner-party.
Take me round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brentin came with us, and we visited each of
the busy roulette-tables in turn. Monte Carlo
was very full, and round some of the tables the
crowd was so deep it was impossible to get near
enough to look, much less to play. But between
the tables there were large vacant spaces of dull-shining,
greasy parquet; the tables looked like
populous places on the map, and the flooring
like open country. Here and there stood the
footmen, straight out of an old Adelphi melodrama;
some of them carried trays and glasses
of water, and some gave you cards to mark the
winning numbers and the colors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not quite so splendid and gay as I imagined,”
my sister observed. “In fact, it’s all
rather dim and dingy. Do you know it reminds
me of the Pavilion at Brighton more than anything
else. And how common some of the people
are! Isn’t that your friend, Mr. Hines?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bob Hines was sitting in rather a melancholy
heap, with a pile of five-franc pieces in front of
him, and a card on which he was morosely writing
the numbers as they came up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s ask him how he’s doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never speak to a gambler,” I whispered;
“it’s considered unlucky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judging from his expression, he will be glad
to get something back in your raid! And why
seat himself between those two terrible old
women?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They look,” Brentin murmured, “like representations
of friend Zola’s the fat and the lean.
Sakes alive! they’d make the fortune of a dime
museum. Those women are freaks, ma’am,
freaks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hines was sitting between two ladies; one,
with a petulant face of old childishness, was
enormously stout. Her eyebrows were densely
blackened, her pendulous cheeks as dusty with
powder as the Mentone road. She was gorgeously
overdressed; her broad bosom, fluid as of
arrested molten tallow, was hung with colored
jewels, like a <span class='it'>bambino</span>. With huge gloved hands
and arms she was wielding a rake, whereof poor
Bob had occasionally the end in his face. Beside
her, on the green cloth, lay a withered
bunch of roses, dead of her large, cruel grasp.
At her back stood her husband, a German Jew
financier, who couldn’t keep his pince-nez on.
Continually he smoothed his thin hair and tried
to get her away, grumbling and moving from leg
to leg; for hours he would stand behind her
chair, supplying her with money, for she nearly
always lost. Occasionally she grabbed other people’s
stakes, or they grabbed hers. Then she
was sublime in her horrible ill-humor; half rising,
with her great arms resting on the table, she
shouted at the croupiers to be paid, in harsh,
rattling, fish-fag tones. The sunken corners of
her small mouth were drawn upward; the deep-set
eyes worked in dull fury; you saw short,
white teeth that once had smiled in a pretty
Watteau face. Now the body was old and torpid
and swollen; but the rabbit intelligence was still
undeveloped, except in the direction of its rapacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Bob Hines! He was indeed badly placed!
On his other side sat a lath-and-plaster widow in
the extensive mourning of a Jay’s advertisement.
Her face was yellow and damaged as a broken old
fresco at Florence; thin, oblong, brittle, only the
semi-circular, blackened eyebrows seemed alive.
The dyed, pallid hair looked dead as a Lowther
Arcade doll’s; dead were her teeth, her long,
thin, griffin hands with curved nails. Decomposition,
even by an emotion, was somehow palpably
arrested; perhaps she was frozen by the
bitter chill of fatal zero. Horrible, old, crape-swathed
mummy, one would have said she had
lost even her husband at play. Who could ever
have been found to love her? At whom had she
ever smiled? at what had she ever laughed or
wept? Bride of Frankenstein’s monster, she
worked her muck-rake with the small, dry, galvanized
gestures of an Edison invention. Poor
Bob Hines! It sickened me to think these
women, and others perhaps worse, were of the
same sisterhood with Lucy. What a day when
we should sweep them all out before us, as the
fresh autumn wind sweeps the withered leaves
across the walks of Kensington Gardens!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is Monte Carlo!” murmured my sister
again. “It stifles me! Take me out to the Café
de Paris and give me some tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she took my arm and we went down the
steps, “Easier place, however, to raid,” she remarked,
“I never saw. As for the morality of
it, I was a little doubtful at first, but now—”</p>

<div class='summary'>
INFLUENCE OF CLIMATE ON ADVENTURE—UNEXPECTED
ARRIVAL OF LUCY—HER REVELATIONS—DANGER
AHEAD
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>So</span> a few days passed, and, pleasantly idle
though it all was, it began to be time for us to
think seriously of our purport in being at Monte
Carlo at all. Our party had very easily fallen
into the ways of the place, and appeared to be
enjoying themselves, each in their own fashion,
amazingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s Teddy’s got a bicycle,” as I said to
Brentin, “and is always over at Mentone with
friends. Bob Hines does nothing but gamble,
and is scarcely ever with us, even at meal-times.
He lives on sandwiches and hot <span class='it'>grog Américaine</span>
at the Café de Paris. Forsyth struts about in
fancy suits, making eyes at the ladies, and Masters
is all day at the back of Miss Rybot’s chair,
supplying her with fresh funds and taking charge
of her winnings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est magnifique</span>,” yawned Brentin, “<span class='it'>mais ce
n’est pas la guerre</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s worse,” I said; “it’s Capua, simply, and
must be put a stop to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know if I were here a fortnight longer,”
yawned my sister, “with nothing to do, I should
desert my husband and child and be off into Italy
along the Corniche with white mice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn pifferari; exactly,” said Brentin.
“Therefore, sir, we must move in this business,
and the sooner the better, or the golden
opportunity will slip by us, never to return.
And that’s all there is to it. We will summon
a council of war this evening on board the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>
and fix the day finally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all I ask is,” said my sister, “that in
case of failure Miss Rybot and I are afforded every
opportunity of escape. I don’t want to give
those Medworth Square people the chance of coming
and crowing over me in a French prison. Besides,
it wouldn’t do Frank’s business any good,
if I were caught.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, just think what a book you could
make of it,” I murmured—“<span class='it'>Penal Servitude for
Life; by a Lady</span>. Rivers would make his fortune.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What would have been, after all, the end of our
adventure, whether the sunshine might not have
softened us into finally abandoning the enterprise
altogether—to my lasting shame and grief!—I
cannot take upon myself to say. All I know for
certain is, that if our hands had not been, in a
measure, forced—if circumstances had not made
it rather more dangerous for us to go back
than to go on—our party would at any rate have
needed an amount of whipping into line which
would as likely as not have driven them into restive
retirement, instead of the somewhat alarmed
advance which was ultimately forced on us and
turned out so entirely successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as it is my particular pride to think I owe
the undertaking, in the first place, to my love for
Lucy, so it is my joy to reflect how the final
carrying of it out was due to her affection for
me, that drove her to journey—quite unused
to foreign parts as she was—right across Europe,
alone, and give me timely warning of the
dastardly scheme on foot for our capture and
ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the very afternoon following the morning
of our brief conversation on the terrace that
I went back early to the hotel, with some natural
feelings of depression and irritation at the growing
callous inertia of our party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was going up to my room, when from the
reading-room I heard the sound of the piano.
I stopped in some amazement, for there was being
played an air I never heard any one but Lucy
play. It was an old Venetian piece of church
music (by Gordigiani, if I remember right), and I
had never heard it anywhere but at “The French
Horn,” on the rather damaged old cottage piano
in the little room behind the bar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stole down-stairs again, and, my heart beating,
opened the glass door noiselessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Lucy! and the next moment, with a
little scream, she was in my arms. I took her to
the sofa; for some moments she was so agitated
she couldn’t speak, nor could I, believing, indeed,
it was a ghost, till I felt the soft pressure
of her arms and the warmth of her cheek as her
head lay on my shoulder, while she trembled and
sobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be frightened,” I murmured. “It’s
really I. Now, don’t cry; be calm and tell me
all about it. We are both safe; we love each
other. Nothing else in the world matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, in broken tones and at first with many
tears, she told me the whole story. I listened as
though I were in a dream, and my bones stiffened
with anger and apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gist of it was briefly this: that one day
Mr. Crage had come down to “The French
Horn” and had an interview with her father in
the bar-parlor. He had come to put an end to
Mr. Thatcher’s tenancy, a yearly one, and turn
him out of the inn, unless, as he suggested, exactly
like a villain on the stage, Lucy would,
for her father’s sake, engage to marry him, in
which case he might remain, and at a reduced
rent. Thatcher, who, after all, is a gentleman,
declared the idea preposterous, more particularly
as his daughter was already engaged, with his full
consent and approbation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ah!” snarled Crage—“to that young cockney
who was down here at Christmas. Suppose
you call her in, however, and let her speak for
herself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Lucy was sent for and told of
Crage’s iniquitous proposal, of which Thatcher
very properly urged her not to think, but to refuse
there and then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ah!” Crage had grinned. “The young
cockney has enough for you all and won’t grudge
it, I dare say. He’s gone to Monte Carlo, ain’t
he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, said Lucy, Mr. Blacker had, and had
promised her not to gamble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gamble or not,” sneered Crage, “I know
what he is up to. The police are already on his
track. Why, I shouldn’t be the least surprised
to hear he’s already in their hands, and condemned
to penal servitude for life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On hearing that, poor Lucy said she thought
she should have dropped on the floor, like water.
But she has the courage of her race, and, telling
the old man in so many words he was mad, turned
to leave the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, it’s an odd thing that the old wretch,
though he never minded being called a liar, never
could bear any reflection on his sanity—it was
the fusty remains, I suppose, of his old professional
Clement’s Inn pride; so he lost his temper
at once, and with many shrieks and gesticulations
told them the whole story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That—as I have written—Bailey Thompson was
a detective, frequently in the “Victoria” smoking-room
in the course of his duty; and that
Brentin had actually confided in him—as we
know—all that we were going to do, that he
was an old friend of Crage’s, dating from the
Clement’s Inn days, and on Christmas night had
divulged the whole scheme just as he had received
it from us, telling him with much glee, being a
season of jollity and good-will, how he was going
to follow us to Monte Carlo and make every disposition
to catch us in the act. Crage added
that Bailey Thompson had rather doubted at
first whether we weren’t humbugging him; but
having since heard from his sister, Mrs. Wingham,
that she believed we were really in earnest,
was already somewhere on his way out to superintend
our capture in person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know what to do,” cried Lucy, piteously;
“I could only laugh in his face and tell
him he was the victim of a practical joke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practical joke!” Crage had screamed; “you
wait till they’re all in prison; perhaps they’ll call
that a practical joke, too. Now, look here,
Thatcher, you’re a sensible man; you break off
this engagement before the scandal overtakes
you all, and I’ll treat you and your daughter
handsomely. You shall stay on in the inn, or
not, just as you please, and the day we’re married
I’ll settle Wharton on dear Lucy here. I sha’n’t
live so very much longer, I dare say,” he whined—“I’m
eighty-two next month—and then she can
marry the young cockney, if she wants to, when
he’s done his time. Don’t decide now; send me
up a note in the course of the next few days.
Hang it! I won’t be hard on you; I’ll give you
both a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with that and no more the wicked old
man had stumped out of the bar parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy’s mind was soon made up. Notwithstanding
her father’s expostulations, she had determined
to come after me and learn the truth
for herself; and as he couldn’t come with her, to
come alone. She hadn’t written, for fear of my
telegraphing she was not to start. And here she
was, to be told the truth, to be reassured, to be
made happy once more; if possible, to take me
home with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s not true, Vincent, dearest!” she murmured.
“It’s all a fable, isn’t it? You’re not
even dreaming of doing anything so dangerous
and foolish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, deep and true as is my affection for Lucy,
I should have been quite unworthy of her if I
had allowed myself to be turned from so deeply
matured and worthy a purpose as ours merely by
her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more I had seen of Monte Carlo, the more
sincerely was I convinced of its worthlessness,
and the dignity of a serious effort to put a stop to
it. For it is simply, as I have written, a <span class='it'>cocotte’s</span>
paradise and nothing more; and if, by any effort
of mine, I could close it, I felt I should be rendering
a service to humanity only second to Wilberforce
and the Slave Trade. What a glorious
moment if only I could live to see a large board
stuck out of the Casino windows with <span class='it'>À Vendre</span>
on it, to say nothing of the boards taken in from
outside the London hospitals and the closed
wards in working order again, full of sufferers!</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I calmed dear Lucy and told her how glad
I was to see her; that above all things she must
trust me and believe what I was doing and going
to do was for the best and would turn out not
unworthy of nor unserviceable to her in the
long-run; more especially, if only it were, as we
had every reason to believe it would be, successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some further talk, she promised to say
no more and to trust me entirely, both now and
always, begging me only to assure her I was not
angry, and that what she had done in coming
was really for my benefit and welfare. I told her
truly she had rendered me the greatest possible
service, and that I loved her if possible more
deeply for this new proof of her devotion than
before. Then I telegraphed to her father of her
safety, got her something to eat, and sent her off
early to bed after her long journey (she had come
second-class, poor child, and had stopped once
at least at every station, and twice at some), and
at nine o’clock we went down to the Condamine
to go on board the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span> for our council of
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way down I told Brentin the reason of
Lucy’s sudden visit, and the new danger from
Bailey Thompson, who by this time was clearly
on his way after us, if indeed he hadn’t already
arrived. At the same time, I candidly confessed
to my indiscretion with Mrs. Wingham, and the
letter I had seen her writing to her brother. We
found no difficulty in agreeing we both had behaved
like arrant fools, and might very fairly be
pictured as standing on the romantic, but uncomfortable,
edge of a precipice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we must go on, sir,” said Brentin, with
decision. “It will never do to back out now,
after coming so far and spending so much money.
We must never allow this shallow detective trash
to frighten us; we must meet him in a friendly
spirit, and find some means to dump him where
he may be both remote and harmless. The Balearic
Isles, for choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about the band of brothers?” I asked.
“How will they regard these fresh revelations?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the difficulty,” replied Brentin,
thoughtfully. “We must exercise care, sir, or
they’ll be scattering off home like Virginia wheat-ears.”</p>

COUNCIL OF WAR—CAPTAIN EVANS’S DECISION—I GO TO
THE ROOMS AND CONFIDE IN MY SISTER
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>When</span> the band of brothers in the saloon on
board the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span> heard all, or rather so much
as we thought fit delicately to tell them, they
turned—collectively and individually—pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then there’s an end of it,” chattered Teddy.
“It was a fool’s journey from the beginning, and
the sooner we all go home again the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sooner you go, sir,” retorted Brentin,
“the easier we shall all breathe. Is there any
other palpitating gentleman desires to climb
down?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment, first,” said Hines; “before we
decide to break up, can’t we consider whether
there may not be a way of either stopping your
friend Bailey Thompson <span class='it'>en route</span>, or at least rendering
him powerless when he arrives? The
fact is,” he diffidently continued, “I have lost a
good deal of money here, and don’t altogether
care about leaving it without an effort of some
kind to get it back, to say nothing of the lark
of the thing, which I take it has been one of its
chief recommendations from the first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To say nothing, too, of the fact—as I knew—that
before leaving Folkestone he had sent out a
circular to the parents of his boys to announce
the addition of a swimming-bath and a gymnasium
to his establishment, the non-erection of
which would surely cause him to look more foolish
than a schoolmaster cares about. And what
would the boys say who had cheered him loudly
at the end of last term, when, in a neat speech,
he had announced his generous intention?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoken like ay white man!” cried Brentin.
“Why, whoever supposed that in an enterprise
of this magnitude there would not arise danger
and difficulties? They are only just beginning,
gentlemen; if any of you, therefore, still desire
to shirk, he has only to say the word. Conveyance
to the shore is immediately at his service;
he can this moment go and pack his grip and be
way off home. We shall be well rid of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause, and then Forsyth said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you going, Parsons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy lighted a cigarette nervously and replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, dash it all, let’s hear what’s proposed
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir!” shouted Brentin, thumping the
table. “You go or you stay, one or the other;
we will have no ha-alf measures. The time for
them has elapsed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” stammered the unhappy Parsons,
“if you are all going to stay, of course I must
stay too. I thought the affair was all over, that’s
why I spoke. I wasn’t thinking, you know, of
deserting my pals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo!” cried Hines, sardonically. “You
ain’t exactly a hero, Parsons, but I dare say you’ll
do very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is just one thing I should like to point
out,” Arthur Masters observed, “before we go
any further. The affair is assuming a somewhat
grave aspect, and it is of course possible that,
in spite of all precautions, we may, after all, be
captured, either on shore or, later, on board the
yacht.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hear! Hear!” Teddy murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, is it fair to get Captain Evans and the
crew into difficulties without letting them know
what we are going to do, and giving them the
chance of refusing to join us first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir,” objected Brentin, “we always
meant to tell him, but not until the last moment,
when we should have claimed their assistance,
if only in removing the boodle. You see,
gentlemen, the British sailor is a fine fellow, but
he is apt to tank-up and get full—full as ay goat,
gentlemen—and in that condition he is confiding.
Now we have unfortunately been confiding when
dry, but the British sailor—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must risk that,” Masters replied. “And,
after all, once they are told and have consented,
they can be refused permission to go on shore
again before we start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Forsyth, “why not have Captain
Evans in and tell him now; then he can
use his discretion as to telling the crew at all till
the last moment, or selecting the most trustworthy
and sober of them for his confidence at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So we decided to send for Captain Evans before
going any further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he stepped into the saloon, smart and
sailor-like, peaked cap in hand, Brentin begged
him to be seated, and gave him one of his longest
and blackest cigars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, “Captain Evans,” he said, “we have
sent for you so that in case of this affair of ours
going wrong you may not have any cause of complaint
against us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, sir!” said the captain, “and what
affair may that be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He listened with the deepest attention and
in complete silence while our scheme was unfolded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, gentlemen,” he said, when Brentin
had finished, “I will be perfectly frank with
you. Your scheme is your own, and you know
best how far it is likely to fail or to succeed.
But if it fails and we are all caught, I shall never
be able to persuade the authorities I was an innocent
party, and there will be an end to any
future employment. I have a wife and a fine
little boy to think of, gentlemen; how am I
going to support them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your objection is perfectly fair, captain,”
said Brentin. “My answer to it is, that if you
get into trouble, I will personally undertake to
make you an allowance of £150 per annum for
the period dooring which you remain out of a
berth. In the case of success, and the boodle
being considerable, you must trust us to make
you such a present or <span class='it'>solatium</span> as shall in my
opinion repay you for any risks you may have
run. How will that do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do, gentlemen, thank you,” the
captain replied. “And what about the crew?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall be glad if you will select six of the
most elegant of your men, whose assistance will
be needed in the rooms on the night. Clothes will
be provided for them, and their duties will be
explained in good time. As for the others, if
they are to be told, they must not be allowed on
shore. To-day is Wednesday; we propose to
start Friday. Till Friday they must be confined
on board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the exception of the cook, gentlemen,”
urged the captain. “He has to go on shore
marketing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t tell the cook. Now, do we
understand each other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One question, captain,” said Brentin, as he
rose. “The French corvette has left the harbor,
I understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, she sailed to Villefranche yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>, what of her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s away over at San Remo, sir, and returns
some time to-night or to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Captain Evans; that will do.
Good-evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friends,” he said, as the captain closed
the door, “this is going to cost a lot of money;
let us hope we shall all come out right
side up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, what about Bailey Thompson?”
Bob Hines asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our plan is obvious,” Brentin replied. “I
must board the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span> first thing in the morning,
reintrodooce myself to Van Ginkel, confide
in him and beg him to take Thompson on board
for us, and be off with him kindly down the
coast. East or west, he can dump him where
he pleases, so long as he does dump him somewhere
and leave him there like dirt. How does
that strike you, gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If only he can be got to go!” I answered;
“and Mrs. Wingham? You must remember it
was he who advised us to go to the Monopôle,
no doubt giving the old lady instructions to
keep an eye on us and report.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Brentin, “Mr. Parsons here is
her friend. He must manage to let her know
we don’t start operations till Saturday. That
will put her off the scent. And now, gentlemen,
let us discuss details and positions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I left them to their discussion and went on
shore to find my sister and Miss Rybot, who
were at the rooms. My sister knew nothing
whatever about Lucy—still less of her being at
Monte Carlo. I had to make a clean breast of
it all, and get her to take Lucy on board the yacht
in the morning, so as to be out of Bailey Thompson’s
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I found them without much difficulty, full as
the rooms were. Miss Rybot was seated, playing
roulette, rather unsuccessfully, if I might judge
from her ill-humored expression. Facing her,
standing staring at her pathetically, with a soft
hat crushed under his arm, was a tall, blond,
sentimental-looking young German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell that man to go away, please,” she said
to me, crossly. “He’s been standing there staring
at me the last half-hour, and he brings me
bad luck. Tell him I hate the sight of him.
Tell him to go away at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I explained that I was scarcely sufficient master
of German for all that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep my place, please,” she said, imperiously,
and went round to the young man, who received
her with a fascinating smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Vous comprenez le Français?</span>” I heard her
say to him, folding her arms and looking him
resolutely full in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui, mademoiselle.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Alors, allez-vous-en, sivooplay</span>,” she went on;
“<span class='it'>je n’aime pas qu’un homme me regarde comme
ça. Vous me portez de la guigne. Allez-vous-en,
ou j’appelle les valets. C’est inouï! Allez-vous-en!
Vous avez une de ces figures qui porte de la
guigne toujours. Entendez-vous? toujours!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that, entirely unconcerned, she resumed
her seat, while the young German, who had hitherto
been under the impression he had made a
conquest, strolled off somewhat alarmed to another
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My sister I found in the farther rooms watching
the <span class='it'>trente-et-quarante</span>. “Hullo, Vincent!”
she said. “Council over? Dear me, I wish I
hadn’t promised Frank not to play; my fingers
are simply tingling. However, I’ve been playing
in imagination and lost 40,000 francs, so perhaps
it’s just as well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I drew her to a side seat and soon told her all
about Lucy and her arrival, softening down the
Bailey Thompson part for fear of alarming her
unduly; giving other reasons for the dear girl’s
sudden descent on us, all more or less true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My good sister was as sympathetic as usual,
only she entreated me to be sure I was really serious
and in earnest this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know, Vincent,” she said, “you have so
often come moaning to me about young ladies,
and I have so often asked them to tea and taken
them to dances for you, and nothing whatever
has come of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that hasn’t been my fault,” I answered.
“I have simply got tired of them, that’s all.
This time I am really in earnest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you always were!” she laughed, “up to a
certain point. Why, you’re a sort of a young
lady-taster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I replied, “how are you to know
what sort of cheese you like unless you taste
several?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather hard on the cheese, isn’t it? The process
of tasting is apt to leave a mark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not in the hands of an adroit and respectable
cheesemonger’s assistant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Vincent,” said my sister, severely, “don’t be
cynical, or I’ll do nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the same, she knew what I said was true.
Men would, I believe, always be faithful if only
they could feel there was anything really to be
faithful to. But they meet an angel at an evening
party, and then, when they go to call, they
find the angel fled and the most ordinary young
person in her place; one scarcely capable of inspiring
a school-boy in the fifth form to the mediocre
height of the most ordinary verse-power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But with Lucy! Sympathetic readers don’t, I
am sure, look for protestations from me where
she’s concerned. At least, not now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The end of our talk was, it was arranged between
us Lucy should go on board the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>
in the morning and there remain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the next morning there she was comfortably
installed, and already looking forward to the
Friday evening, when she was told we were going
to make a move out of harbor, and probably go
home by way of the Italian coast, and possibly
by rail from Venice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything else was kept from her carefully,
which is, I think, the worst of an adventure of
this kind; one is driven to subterfuge even with
those one loves best.</p>

<div class='summary'>
ENTER MR. BAILEY THOMPSON—VAN GINKEL STANDS BY
US—WE SHOW THOMPSON ROUND AND EXPLAIN DETAILS—TEDDY
PARSONS’S ALARM
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> Bailey Thompson problem confronted us
<span class='it'>in propriâ personâ</span> that very same afternoon, the
Thursday, at about half-past four, when, as we
were some of us sitting outside the Café de Paris
at tea, I saw him strolling round the central
flower-beds in front of the rooms. He wore one
of the new soft straw hats, a black frock-coat,
tan shoes, and the invariable dog-skin gloves,
and over his arm he carried a plaid shawl. In
short, he looked like what he was, Scotland Yard
<span class='it'>en voyage</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I pointed him out to Brentin, who immediately
jumped up, crossed the road, and greeted him
with effusion. Then he brought him over and introduced
him to our party, among whom, luckily
enough, was seated Mr. Van Ginkel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I don’t want to say anything uncivil in
print about a gentleman who rendered us later a
service so undeniable, and, indeed, priceless; but
I cannot help observing that Van Ginkel, on the
whole, was one of the dreariest personalities I
ever came in touch with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about Brentin’s age, fifty-four or so,
but he appeared years older; his hair and beard
were almost white, and his face was so lined, the
flesh appeared folded, almost like linen. He had
some digestive troubles that kept him to a milk
diet, and he would sit in entire silence looking
straight ahead of him, searching, as it were, for
the point of time when he should be able to eat
meat once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brentin had boarded the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span> early that
morning on its return, and given a full account
of our scheme and its difficulties. Van Ginkel
had listened in complete silence; and when
Brentin had told him of Bailey Thompson, and
our earnest desire to get him out of the way,
ending by asking him to be so friendly as to take
him on board and keep him there till we had
finished, Van Ginkel had just remarked, “Why,
certainly!” and relapsed into silence again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has very much altered,” Brentin had
whispered, after presenting me; when Van Ginkel
shook me by the hand, said “Mr. Vincent
Blacker,” in the American manner, and was
further entirely dumb. “He was the liveliest
freshman of my class and the terror of the Boston
young ladies, especially when he was full. As,
of course, you know from his name, he is one of
the oldest families of Noo York State.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I replied, “and he looks it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bailey Thompson sat with us for some little
time outside the “Café de Paris,” and made
himself uncommonly agreeable, according to his
Scotland Yard lights. He told us, the hypocrite,
he usually came to Monte Carlo at this time of
the year, and usually stayed at the “Monte
Carlo Hotel,” just where the road begins to descend
to the Condamine, once Madame Blanc’s
villa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Where were we? Oh! some of us were at the
“Monopôle” and some on board the yacht.
Really? Why, the “Monopôle” was the hotel
he had recommended us, wasn’t it? He hoped
we found it fairly quiet and comfortable, and
not too dear, did the arch-hypocrite!</p>

<p class='pindent'>When my sister rose to go back to the rooms
and look after Miss Rybot, Van Ginkel roused
himself to ask her to lunch with him the next
day, Friday, on board the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>, and go for
a sail afterwards to Bordighera. He managed
the affair like an artist, for he didn’t immediately
include Bailey Thompson in the invitation,
as though he knew too little of him just for the
present. It was not till later, as we strolled down
to the Condamine—he, Thompson, Brentin, and
I—that he asked us to come on board the yacht
and see over it, and not till finally as we were
leaving that (as though reminding himself he
must not be impolite) he begged the detective to
be of the party, if he had no other engagement
of the kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson—simple soul!—was enchanted to
accept, and, as we went back on shore in the boat,
went off into raptures at the beauty of the yacht
and the politeness of the owner in asking him
on so short an acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we three strolled up the hill, Brentin, with
the most natural air of trust, at once launched
out on the subject of our plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, here we are, sir, you see,” he said;
“everything is in train. We approach the
hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here am I, too,” smiled the cool little man.
“I told you I should most likely be over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are real glad to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you really mean it, now you’re on the
spot and can measure some of the difficulties
for yourselves?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much so that we have decided for Saturday
night,” was Brentin’s light and untruthful
reply. “We have observed the rooms are at
their fullest then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are the rest of your party—the other
gentlemen I saw at ‘The French Horn?’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Hines is gambling, having unfortunately
developed tastes in that direction. Mr. Masters
is in attendance on a lady friend—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ladies of your party know nothing of
your intentions, I presume?” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, sir; nothing. For them it is a
mere party of pleasure all the time. Then Mr.
Forsyth is playing that fool-game, tennis, with
his late colonel, behind the “Hôtel de Paris,”
and Mr. Parsons is somewhere way off on the
Mentone Road, choking himself with dust on ay
loaned bicycle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the six of you. But now you have
seen everything, do you really think six will be
enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said Brentin, “six stalwarts of our crew
have been confided in. They will be furnished
with linen bags to collect the boodle, directly the
tables are cleared of the croupiers and gamblers
by us; in fact, acting on your kind hint, longshore
suits have been provided them in which
they have already rehearsed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the rooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir, they were there mid-day just before you
came, and their behavior was as scroopulous as
the late Lord Nelson’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was there any difficulty made about their
cards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, none whatever. They went in in pairs,
and each told a different lie: one pair were staying
at the ‘Metropôle,’ another at the ‘de Paris,’
and another at the ‘S. James.’ They were well
coached and they are brainy fellows. They were
informed they must behave like ornaments of
high-toned society, and not expectorate on the
floor; and they paraded in couples, ejaculating
<span class='it'>Haw, demmy!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really!” murmured Bailey Thompson, “these
people deserve to be raided. And that is your
yacht, I suppose, lying off there—the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>, sir. At 9.30 to-morrow—I
should say Saturday!—<span class='it'>Saturday</span> night,
she will have orders to get as close up to the
shore as quickly as she can. If you will step
this way, sir, down on to the terrace here, we will
have pleasure in showing you the spot marked
out by Nature and Providence for our retreat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we showed him the board with <span class='it'>défense
d’entrée au public</span> on it, the steps leading down
on to the railway line, the broken piece of embankment,
so few feet above the shore, Bailey
Thompson gave a low whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord! how simple it is,” he murmured.
“Now you’d think people would take better care
than that of property of such enormous value,
wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said Mr. Brentin, with magisterial emphasis,
“in the simplicity of the idea lies its
grandeur. It is significant of poor human nature
to make difficulties for themselves; they neglect
what lies at their feet, ready to be carted away
for the trouble. Everybody has heard of the
man who stood on your London Bridge offering
sovereigns for a penny apiece, and doing no trade
in them; while we all know the Boer children
played for years with large diamonds, believing
them to be white pebbles. Sir, it’s the same
thing here precisely, and that’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need hardly say, of course, that here there’s a
good deal of risk,” said Thompson. “You have
naturally all of you thought well over that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have thought well over everything. If
you care to attend the rooms on Saturday—<span class='it'>Saturday</span>
night—at about ten, you will see for yourself
how complete in every respect our thought
has been. And you will be amused, I fancy, at
the little scene you will witness, in which I will
undertake, Mr. Bailey Thompson, you shall be
neither hurt nor hustled,” added Mr. Brentin,
considerately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we strolled back with Thompson to his
hotel, I could, having some sort of gift that way,
see quite well what was passing in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, he said to himself, he was an English
detective; why should he interfere to protect
a French company who couldn’t look after
themselves? Why, too, should he spoil gentlemen’s
sport? They didn’t want the money for
themselves; they wanted it (as we had always
been careful to explain) for hospitals and good
works generally. It wasn’t as if we were vulgar
cracksmen, long firm swindlers, gentry he had
been brought up to struggle with and defeat
all his life. Hang it all! we were gentlemen
and had treated him well, quite as one of ourselves.
We had been frank and above-board,
and had told him everything from the first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could see it was on the tip of his tongue to
blurt out: “Mr. Brentin and Mr. Blacker! you
have been quite frank with me, and, at any cost,
I will be quite frank with you. I am a detective
from Scotland Yard, and unless you promise me
to give up this scheme of yours—which, as
Heaven shall judge me, will, I believe, be successful!—it
will be my unpleasant duty to warn
the police here and have you all arrested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there lay the difficulty, eh? We could
scarcely be arrested for an idea, without overt
act of any kind. Wouldn’t it be a complete
answer if we declared the whole thing a practical
joke, and turned the tables by laughing at
him for being so simple as to believe it? No,
if we were to be successfully caught, we must be
caught in the act, that was clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I felt the detective was too strong in
him: the desire for the reward, the fame of such
a capture; his professional pride, in short, bulked
too large before him to be ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No! he said to himself, if we would go on
with it, why we must take the consequences.
For his part, he would go to the Principality
police, arm a couple of dozen of them, and have
them ready in the rooms. It would be a simple
matter, for hadn’t we always told him our revolvers
would not be loaded?</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, after a long silence, he ended by shrugging
his shoulders, I was as well aware of his resolve
as though he had spoken it out loud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left him at the door of his hotel, undertaking
to meet him in the rooms at nine and
show him every detail of our plan, so that we
might have the benefit of his final advice on any
possible weak points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is, of course, the chance,” I observed
to Brentin, “of his going off at once to the police,
and getting them to be present on Friday night
as well, <span class='it'>ex majori cautelâ</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he won’t do that! We’ve told him no
lies at present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None at any rate that he has discovered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same thing!—and if we say Saturday, he
probably believes we mean it. He won’t go to the
police till the very last moment; he wouldn’t go
then if only there were any way of managing the
business by himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And our ultimate arrest, now that he knows
us all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, sir, that will be the affair of the authorities
here; that is, of course, the chief risk
we have now to run. My own notion, however,
always has been that, if only for fear of advertising
our success too widely, and suggesting the
scheme to others, the Casino Company will put
up with their loss, just as though we had legitimately
won the boodle at play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us hope so!” I said, and parted from
him with a warm grasp of the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I went down to the Condamine, and
signalled for the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span> boat. We had left
Lucy on board all day, for fear of her running
up against Bailey Thompson on shore, and so
arousing his suspicions by her presence. As for
old Crage’s finding means to let him know what,
in a fit of temper, he had blurted out, that I
didn’t think altogether likely; in the first place,
he would probably be afraid; and in the second,
he would believe Lucy had by this time warned
us and the whole affair was off. So I spent a
very happy hour with dear Lucy on board, finding
her sewing in a very bewitching tea-gown of
my sister’s, and, going back to the hotel, discovered
Teddy outside in a considerable state of
alarm and excitement. He had just seen Thompson
leaving the hotel, parting from Mrs. Wingham
at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Vincent!” he cried, “it’s not too late;
we’d better hook it, we had really!”—and other
terrified absurdities—the fact being, no doubt,
that Thompson had merely come up to see the
old lady and find out from her whether she
knew if Saturday really was the day, or if we
were by any chance trying to put him off the
scent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I calmed Teddy with the assurance all was
going on perfectly well, and that he had only to
keep calm to do himself and his militia training
full justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hang it all!” I said to him, “you are as
nearly as possible a British officer; do, for goodness’
sake, try and behave like one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he never did, from first to last; and for
that, painful as it is, I feel myself obliged publicly
to censure him here, in print.</p>

<h2 id='p146'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1em;'>EXIT MR. BAILEY THOMPSON</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Friday</span> dawned, blue and auspicious, and
soon after twelve Brentin and I called at his
hotel to conduct the luckless Thompson on board
the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>. We had matured our little plan,
and as we went down the hill to the Condamine
we began to put it in motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this wise. Brentin suddenly pulled up
short, saying: “Sakes alive! I have forgotten
to telegraph to the hotel at Venice to secure
our rooms. Mr. Blacker, will you conduct our
friend to the boat, and I will join you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went on with Thompson to the boat lying
ready for us, and there we waited. Then at the
top of the hill appeared Brentin, as per arrangement,
outside the telegraph office, making weird
signals with his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth is he doing?” I innocently
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He apparently wants you,” replied the unsuspicious
Thompson; “perhaps he has forgotten
the name of the hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Lord!” I ejaculated, “and I shall have
to go all the way back up that horrible hill.
Don’t you wait for me, please. If you don’t
mind just going on board and sending the boat
back, we shall be ready, and by that time Parsons
and Hines will have joined us. We are a
little too early as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The others come from the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>, I presume?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; there’s the boat”—for we had arranged
they should at any rate start, and not turn back
till they had seen the detective decoyed below
deck on board the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Au revoir!</span>” I cried, and without turning,
up the hill I hastened, only too delighted and
relieved to hear the boat put off and the soft
plash of the oars behind me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I never turned till I got to the telegraph office,
and then Brentin and I stood there and watched
with breathless interest. Brentin had glasses
with him, and at once turned them on the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Van Ginkel receives him,” he chuckled,
“with stately, old-fashioned courtesy. Thompson
explains how it is he is alone, and that the
boat is to go back for us. Van Ginkel insists on
taking his plaid shawl, and entreats him to come
below out of the sun. He leads the way, and they
go to the head of the saloon companion-ladder,
engaged in affable conversation and friendly rivalry
for the shawl. They disappear. Bravo!
The <span class='it'>Amaranth</span> boat turns back. The <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>
men rapidly haul their own boat on board. The
anchor is apparently already weighed. Animated
figures cross and recross the deck. Orders are
rapidly given—she’s off! By Heaven, sir, she’s off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long pause, while the shapely <span class='it'>Saratoga</span> begins
to leave the harbor and head for the open
sea. She crosses the bows of the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>,
where the rest of our company are standing, with
Captain Evans and his crew, waiting and watching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, ha!” roared Brentin, suddenly. “Thompson’s
head reappears, without his hat. He looks
round him, scared. He hurries to the captain,
who is walking the bridge, his hands behind him,
his eye watchful. He speaks to the captain.
He shouts, he beats the bridge, he foams at the
mouth. The captain pays him no heed—no heed,
sir, whatever. He even casually steps on his
fingers. Ha! he rushes to the man at the wheel.
He gesticulates, he yells, he attempts to seize
the wheel. Steady, Scotland Yard! You should
know better than that. Bravo! The man at
the wheel kicks a long leg out at him and shouts
to the captain. The captain gives sharp, decisive
orders. Bravo! Well done! Bailey Thompson
is seized by a couple of Long Tom Coffins and
hurried away. They hurry him, struggling violently,
to the head of the companion-ladder.
Down with him, gentlemen! Down with him,
among the dead men! Bravo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bailey Thompson’s struggle and discomfiture
were watched by our friends on the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>
with interest at least as keen as ours. As the
<span class='it'>Saratoga</span> fell away across their bows, and Thompson
disappeared down the companion-ladder,
Captain Evans takes off his cap and leads his
brave fellows to a cheer. They cheer vociferously
and derisively, the ladies wave their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exit Mr. Bailey Thompson!” cried Brentin,
and taking off his hat he gave a loud “Hurray!”
much to the astonishment of the man outside
the telegraph office, who stands there with a
tray of colored pince-nez for sale, as a protection
against the Monte Carlo glare of white roads
and blue sparkling sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then up came Parsons and Hines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, is it all right? Has he gone? Have
they got him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look for yourselves, gentlemen!” he cried,
handing them the glass. “Search earth and sky
for vestiges of Mr. Bailey Thompson, of Scotland
Yard and Brixton. You will not find him.
He has passed out of our ken. He’s on his way
to Majorca, Minorca, Ivaca, and the Balearic Isles
generally. For purposes of any active mischief
he is as dead and harmless as the dodo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the present—only for the present!” muttered
Teddy, who was in his usual pallid condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Brentin, with satisfaction,
putting away his glasses, “rebellion being dead,
let us go back to the ‘Monopôle,’ enjoy our
breakfast, and pay our bill. Then we pack up
and get our things on board the yacht. Fortune
smiles on us, gentlemen,” he added, “as ever on
the bold. Nothing, so far, could be better!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the terrace of the “Monopôle” we took a
last look over the sea before going in to breakfast.
There was the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>, rapidly growing diminutive
as she bustled far away out to sea to the
right. Exit Mr. Bailey Thompson, indeed!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Wingham’s place, between Mrs. Sellars
and Miss Marter, was empty. They told Teddy
the old lady had breakfasted early, and was down
at the rooms for a long afternoon’s play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Mr. Parsons was leaving? How sorry
they were—how much they would miss him!
Certainly they would say good-bye to Mrs. Wingham
for him. Oh, we were all going to Bordighera
in a friend’s yacht, and should most probably
not return. Well, good-bye. <span class='it'>Bon voyage!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now she’ll think,” said the sagacious Teddy,
as he joined us, “the whole affair’s off, notwithstanding
my telling her it was fixed for
Saturday. She’ll fancy we’ve got frightened, or
been warned, and have bolted. Good business!”</p>

</div>

<div class='summary'>
THE GREAT NIGHT—DINNER AT THE “HÔTEL DE PARIS”—A
LAST LOOK ROUND—THE SACK AND ITS INCIDENTS—FLIGHT
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>By</span> five o’clock of that same afternoon—Friday,
January 17th—we and our luggage were all
safe on board the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our luggage stowed away and our cabin arrangements
made (rather a tight fit we found it),
I took Lucy on shore to show her round, or give
her a walk rather, as it was nearly dark; for
now that Bailey Thompson was well out at sea,
there was no danger of her being met and recognized.
For the night, our plan of action briefly
was, that at a quarter to eight we were all to
dine together at the “Hôtel de Paris,” the ladies
afterwards to return on board the yacht. At
ten we gentlemen, with the six sailors, were to
be in the rooms; at half-past, precisely, the start
was to be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At ten-twenty the boats, two of them, were to
leave the yacht and be ready at the spot I have
indicated. They were not to start a minute
earlier, for fear of exciting suspicions among any
of the firemen or police who might be about on
the terrace. For them, on Brentin’s suggestion,
we had arranged a small pyrotechnic display—what
he called “fire-crackers”—on the terrace
not far from the band-stand. Parsons had purchased
a “Devil among the Tailors” over at Mentone,
and Jarvis, one of the sailors—the same, by-the-way,
who had first accosted us on the pier
at Ryde—was to light it one minute before the
half-hour. We calculated it would explode and
draw the firemen away, just about the time when
they would otherwise be in demand to stop us in
our rush down the terrace steps, and through
the rickety gate on to the railway line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our dinner at the “Hôtel de Paris” was a very
expensive and merry one. It was lucky, by-the-way,
as it turned out, that I ate and drank a
good deal more than usual, for it was almost
four-and-twenty hours before I got anything approaching
a proper meal again; through that
idiot Teddy Parsons’ fault, as presently will
plainly enough appear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon after half-past nine we sent the ladies off
in a carriage down to the Condamine to go on
board the yacht. It was a solemn moment, for
it was quite on the cards I might never see any
of them again, and one was my sweetheart and
one my sister. Indeed, so affected was I, that I
bent into the carriage and kissed Miss Rybot
by mistake, which made everybody but Arthur
Masters laugh. I knew I had made the mistake
directly my lips touched her cheek, for hers was
hard and cold as an apple off wet grass, whereas
dear Lucy’s was ever soft and warm as a sunny
peach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they drove away, laughing and kissing
their hands; Lucy particularly merry, for she
still knew nothing of what we were almost immediately
going to do, and was quite gay at the
thought of leaving Monte Carlo so soon—to
which unhallowed spot, as most good and sensitive
women, she had taken the supremest dislike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We gentlemen sat a little time smoking, in
somewhat perturbed silence, and just before ten
we had a glass of old brandy each, paid our bill,
and left. The others went on into the rooms,
while Brentin and I walked down on to the terrace
to have a last look at the gate, and see it
was still open; or, rather, would open to a slight
push.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was singularly mild, dark, and heavy;
the terrace absolutely deserted. There was not
a star in the dense, low sky; they all seemed
fallen on shore, outlining the Condamine and
heights of Monaco in the many regular pin-pricks
of the gas-lamps. From the “Café de Paris”
came the swirl of the Hungarian band; from the
Casino concert-room, the high notes of Madame
Eames singing in the new opera; from the Condamine,
the jingle of the omnibus bells. Not another
sound of life from earth or heaven; but
mainly the persistent jangle of those omnibus
bells, as though sadly shaken by some dyspeptic
Folly. The Mediterranean, as ever, was absolutely
still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could have stayed there a long time, but—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!” whispered Brentin, and taking my
arm, walked me back up the steps towards the
rooms. As we passed the end of the concert-room,
I noticed that up against the outside balconies,
at the back of the stage, ladders were
reared, so that, in case of fire, the artistes
might have some other chance of escape than
the dubious one of fighting their way through
the <span class='it'>salle</span>. I found myself fitfully wondering
whether those ladders would be used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come!” whispered Brentin, again, feeling, I
dare say, the alarm in my elbow. “Courage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For I do not mind confessing here in print
that, as the hour approached, I began to feel
frightened at the audacity of what we were going
to do, and, if only I could—consistently with
my honor—would willingly have withdrawn;
nay, to put it plainly, turned tail and bolted.
My revolver, loaded with blank cartridge only, in
the pocket of my smoking-jacket beat remindfully
against my hip as I walked up the Casino
steps. Even now as I write, months after the occurrence,
the tremor of that hour seizes me and
my hand shakes so I can scarcely guide the pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another moment, and we had walked through
the hall, and passed the swing-doors into the
stifling gambling-rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is extremely unlikely I ever visit Monte
Carlo again; indeed, my conduct, on this the
last occasion I entered the rooms, rather precludes
me from ever even making the attempt;
but if ever I do, they will never make the same
impression on me as they did that warm January
evening when Brentin and I strolled into them
arm in arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every incident of that memorable evening,
every face I then saw, is photographed into my
memory, still remains there distinct and indelible.
The rooms, either because of the attraction
of a new opera or because the night was so
warm, were somewhat empty. The crowds were
only round the table, and the parquet flooring
between looked more than usually vacant and
dull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dimmer they looked, too, and more than ever
badly lit; and the air seemed even heavier
charged with gamblers’ exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in some slight particulars, we had modified
our original plan. We had long given over
all attempt to turn the light out, for one thing,
since we had never been able to discover where
the mains were; probably somewhere well out
of sight, down below among the vaults, which
also we had decided not to attempt. Nor did we
intend to do anything towards securing the gamblers’
valuables, as at one time we had projected.
It was very like vulgar robbery, to begin with,
and next, as Thompson had pointed out, it would
take too much time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Directly we got inside, Brentin looked up at
the clock over the door and set his watch by it;
then we strolled off to find the rest, and, showing
each of them the watch, saw that each had
the precise time. Our six sailors were wandering
about genteelly in pairs; to each Brentin whispered,
“Got your bag all right?” and each
nodded a reply. Each had a linen bag buttoned
inside his short, respectable reefer jacket. One
who, I fear, was not quite sober, a man named
Barker, took his bag out with a stupid laugh
to show us; whereupon his companion (Frank
Joyce, from Sandown, in the Isle of Wight, who
had him by the arm) said, “Now then, Barker,
don’t be a fool, it ain’t time yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then between the ten minutes and the
quarter past ten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we had visited the rooms with Bailey
Thompson the night before, and explained our
plan in detail on the spot, we had, by his advice,
and very wisely, reversed it. Previously, we had
designed to begin at the first, the <span class='it'>roulette</span> tables,
and drive the people gradually before us into the
last room, towards the <span class='it'>trente-et-quarante</span>; but
that, as he pointed out, would force us to work
with our backs to the exit and bring us between
two fires as it were; whereas, if we began in the
farthest rooms and cleared the <span class='it'>trente-et-quarante</span>
tables first, we should have our faces to the
doors, and, by driving everybody before us, secure
the further advantage of increasing the confusion
that would arise from the people rushing in
to see what was wrong and meeting the people
rushing out. And through that surging, terrified
mass we ought to have no difficulty in forcing
a passage, if only we kept our unloaded
revolvers up to the mark and frowned unflinchingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for masking ourselves, which we had also
at first designed, Thompson was strongly against
it; it would all take time, and might only obscure
our vision; for, as he truly pointed out,
that sort of thing scarcely ever fits properly....
I gave a nervous glance at my watch, and found
it nearly ten-twenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was standing just by the last <span class='it'>roulette</span> table,
and saw one or two little things that, as I have
said, are still distinctly photographed in my
memory. There were two young men standing
behind me, and one said, “I’ll just chuck a louis
on the table and see where it will fall.” It fell
on the number eighteen, and eighteen actually
turned up! He laughed excitedly as the croupier
pushed him thirty-five times his stake. “That’s
not bad for my one gentle little louis, eh?” he
giggled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opposite, a brown-faced English yachtsman,
over from Mentone, was steadily backing the
colors with notes of five hundred francs. He
was always right; he changed from side to side,
and always hit the right red or black. He was
watched by two common Englishmen, with long
upper lips and ridiculous pantaloon beards,
dressed in shiny broadcloth. “That feller’s won
another twenty-pound,” said one of them, gaping.
“We must bring Louisa in to see this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now it was past the ten-twenty, and I moved
off into the <span class='it'>trente-et-quarante</span> rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one who has been to Monte Carlo knows
that the four <span class='it'>trente-et-quarante</span> tables are in the
two end rooms, two in each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the right-hand room were to be stationed
Brentin, Parsons, and I, with three of the sailors;
in the left, Forsyth, Masters, and Hines,
with the other three. Brentin was to give the
signal in our room—“<span class='it'>Levez les mains!</span>”—and
Hines in the other, while the immediate discharge
of the “Devil among the Tailors” outside on the
terrace would, we hoped, increase the confusion
and alarm within. It was rather awkward that
we were forced to go to work a little out of sight
of each other; for, though there is an opening
between the rooms, we meant to begin well at
the back, and the opening did not so far reach
as to bring us in sight of each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was close on the twenty-five minutes past
ten, and so alarmed was I at the difficulties
which, now we were actually on the spot ready
to overcome them, loomed so desperately large,
that I would willingly have sacrificed half my income
to be allowed to leave without even making
the attempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On one side of me was Brentin; on the other
a very pretty, smart young Englishwoman,
standing with a purse in her hand, watching the
run on black. As in a dream, I noticed all the
details of her dress, the white facings of her
dark jacket on the cuffs and pockets, the piquant
spots on her veil. Quietly, as though she were
paying for a pair of gloves, she staked all the
gold she had left, about twenty pounds, and lost
that. She searched her purse, found it quite
empty, snapped it leisurely, and sauntered away.
Brentin whispered me he had seen her stake roll
after roll of notes, and lose them all. Beautifully
dressed, with a hanging, jewelled little
watch and many neat gold bracelets, I had often
seen her strolling about the gardens, neither
speaking to nor looking at any one; now I found
myself stupidly wondering who she was, even envying
her, notwithstanding her totally cleaned-out
condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The relentless minutes stole on. I looked
piteously at Brentin, glaring with resolution
straight in front of him, his hand in his pocket
fingering his revolver; at Parsons, white as this
paper, his legs bending under him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Piteously I looked at the table in front of me;
at the croupiers, with their cropped black heads
and emotionless faces; at the <span class='it'>chef</span> sitting above
them, his bored, round back towards me; at the
delicately pretty, demure Italian, olive-skinned
and colorless, leaning her arm, in its long white
glove, over the back of his chair; at the young
Frenchman staking his thousand-franc notes,
his forehead and eyes twitching with excitement,
or some nervous complaint; at the gaunt English
girl—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Bang!</span> from the terrace outside. <span class='it'>Bang!
bang!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I gave a jump like a terrified horse. It was
the “Devil among the Tailors,” set off a minute
or two too soon by our friend and accomplice,
the sailor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The confusion and alarm it caused was nothing
compared to what followed. I had just time
to see the Italian lady’s frightened profile, as she
turned and put her white glove up to her smooth
cheek, when the bold Brentin gave a hoarse
shout—“<span class='it'>Levez les mains!</span>”—and produced the
revolver. Then, indeed, a panic set in! comparable,
I imagine, to nothing but the sudden striking
of a ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first a dead pause, and then immediately a
rushing to and fro, as of rats in a pit, the haggard
looking in each other’s fallen, discomposed
faces. And then the noise! the overthrow of
chairs and the dragging of them along the parquet
floor, caught in screaming women’s dresses
as they scudded away like sea-shore birds, bent
low, with their hands up to their ears, while the
shouting, swearing, groaning men clutched at
their money, and tried to thrust it in their
pockets, as they leaped and huddled themselves
away, the louis falling and tinkling on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw before me a hideous, moving frieze of
terror, of distorted faces—Russian, French, German,
Italian, English, American, Greek—all reduced
to the same monotony of look under the
overmastering influence of the same passion—abject
fear. The English were no better than
the rest; they were a little quicker in getting
away, perhaps, and that was all. The confusion
of tongues was as complete as though, on the
Tower of Babel, some one had screamed the
foundations were giving way, and all must save
themselves as best they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in a battle the soldier knows only incidents,
the faces he sees as frightened or determined
as his own, the eyes peering into his
through smoke he mostly himself seems to make;
so, out of this action—so famous and yet so little
known—can I only report the events that met
me in my narrow section of the struggle, a section
drawn almost in parallel straight lines from
the point I started at to the point of exit at the
farther end of the rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First it was the <span class='it'>chef</span>, on his high chair facing
me, who fell over backwards, ridiculous enough
at such a time of tragic import. One of the
croupiers, in jumping horrified to his feet, gave
him a tilt and over he went. He was a youngish
man, with round, fat, clean-shaven cheeks, and a
small, bristling, black mustache. His arms and
legs waved and kicked like an impaled insect;
his mouth opened with a stupendous screaming
oath, and as he fell—strange how at all times
one notices details!—I saw he wore half-shoes
and blue socks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In another minute we were at the vacant table,
the <span class='it'>chef</span> crawling away under a sofa-seat against
the wall, and two of our gallant sailors were
stuffing the notes and coins into their linen bags.
The second table was equally deserted, and there
the not-quite-sober sailor, Barker, with empty,
delighted laughter, was already scratching the
notes out of the metal stand they are always kept
in. Suddenly I saw he nearly fell; some one
under the table had him by the leg. He clutched
the <span class='it'>chef’s</span> empty high chair, and, with a mighty
oath and mighty random kick, released himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hurry up, men! hurry up!” chanted Brentin,
as we moved forward irresistibly over the
bare floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Bang!</span> suddenly went Teddy’s revolver off,
in his nervousness, close to my ear. It was a
mistake, but not altogether a disastrous one; it
showed we were in earnest, and soon cleared
some of the people away from the space between
the roulette rooms and the <span class='it'>trente-et-quarante</span>.
Like a wave that breaks against the shore and
then returns, so these broken people, spent
against the struggling mass round the swing-doors,
had gushed back again and almost reached
the point they started from.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the room on the left, where Hines and
his party were at work, I suddenly heard Arthur
Masters shout, “Look out, Forsyth!” At what,
I know not; I just gave a look in their direction,
and their room seemed as vacant of opposition as
ours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forward!” cried Brentin. “Hurry up!
hurry up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailors, with their bags, fell behind us,
and forward we three charged. As we came
through the sort of ante-chamber dividing the
rooms, there, through the other door, at the
same moment, came Hines, Forsyth, and Masters,
hurrying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo!” screamed to them the excited Brentin.
“The left-hand table, gentlemen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Right and left the tables were absolutely deserted.
As the sailors pounced on and proceeded
to clear them, I had an unobstructed view down
the length of the remaining rooms right to the
exit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a scene of terrified, shouting, screaming
confusion I never saw; nor ever shall, unless my
lurid evil star should one day carry me into the
hot heart of a theatre-panic, the uncontrollable
frenzied meeting of a fighting pit, gallery, dress
circle, and stalls. They say a man will give all he
hath for his life, and here were innumerable men
and women, believing their precious lives in peril,
giving all their fiery energies play in their efforts
to best their neighbor and reach the door. Often,
by-the-way, as I have heard of people wringing
their hands, this was the only occasion on which
I ever really saw it done. One of the footmen,
in his absurd, ill-fitting livery, was standing on
one of the side sofas, a chap with laughable long
whiskers, a discolored beak of a nose, and a rabbit
mouth; there he stood, dancing up and down,
his face all puckered with terror, actually wringing
his hands in his misfitting long sleeves.
Then he suddenly fell over and crawled away,
yelping like a frightened lap-dog, and for the
life of me I couldn’t help a spirit of laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gracious!” yelled Brentin, above the indescribable
din, “I hope no one will be injured.
Loose off your gun, friend Parsons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Bang!</span> went Teddy’s revolver. I looked at
him; his face was still dead white, while his
mouth was working and distorted with a dreadful
grin. <span class='it'>Bang!</span> it went again, while Teddy
gave a silly laugh. Like a shot in a mine
that clears the air, or like the blowing out of
a candle at ten paces, the blank discharge had
its due effect. The tortured mass heaved and
groaned, yielding irresistibly to the pressure of
their terrors; irresistibly they began to pour and
gush out through the swing-doors at the end.
Every second, so fast they went, our road to
safety was notably being cleared for us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forward! Forward!” Brentin sang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the right we went again into the next
room, in the same irreproachable order, with
the same sublime results. Arthur Masters, in
all the energetic glory of battle, was waving his
revolver, trying to crack it, beating it against
his thigh, as though it were a whip, cheering
on his men like hounds. He is master, as I have
mentioned, of a pack of harriers in Hertfordshire,
and all the time he was at work in the last
two rooms he was musically crying, “Melody!
Harmony! Trixie! Hie over, lass, hie over!”
And once, as one of his sailors bent on the floor
over a few scattered louis, he roared at him,
“ ’Ware trash!” When safe in England, I told
him of it afterwards. He laughed and declared
he hadn’t the slightest recollection of doing anything
of the sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now will it be believed that, so universal was
the panic, at one of the tables only, at the bottom
one in the room before the last, was there
anybody found to receive us! And that not so
much, I fancy, in the spirit of opposition as of
curiosity, or perhaps inability to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For there we found an English lady tranquilly
seated—elderly, perhaps sixty, with a shrewd,
not unpleasant face. To this day I don’t know
her name, but I know her quite well by sight,
having often seen her driving in Piccadilly and
Bond Street. At the back of her chair her husband
was standing, eye-glass in eye; a tall man
with a large head, rather of the empty House of
Commons air of importance, coolly watching us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will be good enough not to touch this
lady’s money,” he said, as our men pounced on
the table. Then, as a sort of after-thought, he
added, “You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Write to the <span class='it'>Times</span>,” chuckled Brentin, impudently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady looked hard at me, as much as to
say, “I’ve seen <span class='it'>you</span> somewhere before, more respectably
engaged than this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, before I forget, it is an odd thing that,
only a week or so ago, I again met her driving
in Piccadilly; I was in a cab with Lucy, and we
met her victoria face to face. We stood side by
side for quite three minutes in a block, and she
recognized and stared at me in astonishment. I
returned her stare, not rudely, I hope, and then
positively couldn’t help beginning to laugh; she
didn’t laugh back, but I could see quite well
she was very near it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There still remained the end room of all and
our exit through the doors. Now was the time
for all our nerve, all our resource.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Breathlessly, I glanced up at the clock, and
saw it was just over the twenty-five minutes to
eleven. We had taken only some six or seven
minutes to clear eleven tables; there still remained
the two last and our rush for the yacht.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our friends on the left hurried up to us, we
having been slightly quicker on the right; and
then, strangely enough, there was a moment’s
dead silence, at any rate, in the rooms. In the
pause we could hear the dull, frightened roar
from the hall outside, and then, suddenly and
faintly, the short, sharp, defiant call of a bugle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gamblers and croupiers, still massed struggling
round the exit, turned, many of them as
though by an understanding, and faced us, some
of them even crying “<span class='it'>Silence!</span>” “<span class='it'>Silence!</span>” The
valets, clambering on the side seats, leaned towards
us expectantly. It seemed as though they
were looking for us to make them a speech, some
kind of an apology for our inexplicable and outrageous
conduct. It was a sort of “Gentlemen of
the French Guard, fire first!” and though I don’t
suppose it lasted more than a second, it seemed
an age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Brentin stepped forward, and sweeping
his revolver along the line of their expectant
faces, said in his ordinary voice—and all the
more authoritative and effective it sounded—“<span class='it'>Retirez-vous!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My gaze was fixed on a tall croupier, a man I
had often seen walking about in a straw-hat
with his little daughter; indeed, once I had
stopped and kissed the child, she was so pretty.
Then he had been delighted; now he was staring
at me with hard, frightened eyes, grinding his
teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Brentin stepped forward, we stepped forward
too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Close up behind us, you men!” Masters
called to the sailors. “Use your fists if they
try to stop you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the screaming and shouting began
again. As we moved briskly and irresistibly forward,
the seething crowd at the swing-doors
melted away before us like wax before the fire.
Men and women began to steal behind us and
run back frantically into the vacant rooms we
had just stripped and left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Retirez-vous!</span>” cried Brentin, in a higher key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I kept my eye on the tall croupier, clearly
meditating mischief, and then suddenly covered
him with my unloaded revolver. His face fell
like a shutter; all at once he seemed to be struck
imbecile. Death was staring at him, he fancied,
down the stubborn, steel tube—death! and he had
never made his <span class='it'>salut</span>—would die in the gambling-rooms!
He fell back with the rest, using his
elbows viciously, and out we went with a rush,
like uncorked soda-water opened by an unskilful
hand at a picnic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An arm reached out at me from behind the
door as I darted through, and caught my coat.
I gave myself a vigorous wrench and swore (the
first and only time that night), while my pocket
came tearing off in the villain’s grasp. He was
very welcome to it, if only as a souvenir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hall was pretty empty, for most people
who had escaped from the rooms had rushed
wildly out into the night, in their terror. When
the “Devil among the Tailors” first went off on
the terrace, there had been shouts and cries of
“<span class='it'>Les Anarchistes!</span>” and all who heard it thought
the building was about to be blown to atoms with
a bomb, and flew, like sand before the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, numbers were beginning to pour into the
far end of the hall out from the concert-room,
where the alarm was just spreading and playing
the deuce with the new opera. As we ran
through and down the steps to the right, I could
hear the band still playing and some one singing.
Then, evidently, the alarm reached the instrumentalists,
for they stopped suddenly with a
wheeze, like a musical box run down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down the steps we rushed, knocking some few
of both sexes, I am ashamed to say, over and
aside in our stride. Out of the watchful corner
of my right eye I saw the waiters come running
out of the “Café de Paris,” in their white aprons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside, as we turned the corner of the building,
to the left down on to the terrace, one or two
firemen came bounding up the steps to meet us.
One of them faced us, holding out his arms and
saying something in French I didn’t catch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was addressed to Barker, whose only reply
was to grunt and knock the man head over heels
into a heap of cactus. Hating violence as I do,
I am pleased to report it was absolutely the only
blow struck the whole time, and was a singularly
efficient one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the bottom of the steps to the right we
darted, so close together we might have been
almost covered with a pocket-handkerchief, of
the larger Derby-winner type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get in front, you men!” panted Brentin, in
a sibilant whisper. “Take the first boat, this
way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sailors plunged in front as Brentin pulled
the gate open. Down the steps they clattered.
One of them, as he passed me, I saw was trying
to tie the tape round the neck of his linen bag
with his teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now furious steps were rushing after us
over the gravel of the terrace; menacing dark
figures, many of them, were making for our
gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give ’em a fusillade!” hissed Hines, and
turning we fired, each of us, pretty nearly the
whole of our six blank barrels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that moment our retreat, which had
hitherto been conducted in such beautiful order,
became as loose and streaming as the tail of a
comet. As for me, I fired most of my six barrels
as I ran down the steps, straight over my head,
anywhere. I can feel now the soft kick of my
revolver as I held it loosely in my left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I don’t know it is exactly to my credit,
but it certainly says something for my physical
condition, that I was first down. I plunged
panting across the railway lines, and simply
hurled myself down the embankment, on to the
shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first boat with the sailors already in it, the
boodle in its linen bags gleaming ghostily in a
tumbled heap at the bottom, was just pushing
off. I tore through the water up to my waist,
and they soon had me on board, pulling me in
excitedly by the arms. The night was so dark
that, a dozen strokes from the shore, there was
nothing to be seen but the yacht’s lights, fifty
yards ahead. We flew over the water, the men
talking, swearing, panting, and helping one another
push at the oars. We were alongside almost
immediately, and I was the first up on
deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All safe, sir?” cried the captain, as I swung
myself up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get her ready,” I panted, “the others will
be here in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My sister ran up and kissed me. Miss Rybot
was standing at the taffrail, glaring like a young
eagle over the black water, and drumming her
fingers on the rail. A few heavy raindrops were
beginning to fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s Lucy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We sent her below; she’s reading a book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I paused to listen for the other boat, and could
hear the tearing of the oars, the thud of the rowlocks.
Away down from Monaco came the stern
and menacing beat of a drum. Through the
open lighted windows of the Casino concert-room
I could see dark figures preparing to descend
the ladders I had noticed considerately
placed there against the balconies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, suddenly, for the first time since
we had been aboard, just as the other boat came
tearing alongside and I stumbled off breathlessly
below, it began to rain in earnest, a seething,
hissing downpour; what my old Derbyshire
nurse used picturesquely to call, <span class='it'>whole water</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time I reached Lucy’s cabin door we
were well under weigh, shouldering our way
swiftly and sturdily through the still, wet night.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<div class='summary'>
WE DISCOVER TEDDY PARSONS IS LEFT BEHIND—I MAKE
UP MY MIND—TO THE RESCUE!—UNMANLY CONDUCT
OF THE OTHERS—I GO ALONE—DISGUISE—THE GARDE
CHAMPÊTRE
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>It’s</span> all over!” I cried to Lucy, as I stumbled
in; “we’ve done it beautifully! We’re all
safe, without a scratch!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, so overwrought was I with the long
tension, I became quite hysterical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I went off into a fit of laughter, and at last, with
the silly, happy tears chasing one another like
sheep down my face, I managed to tell her she
was free now to go back to Wharton Park with
her father and grandmother, that Bob Hines
would have his swimming-bath and gymnasium,
that the ho-ho-hospitals would all open their
closed wards again, and Teddy Parsons breathe
freely once more before his fierce old governor,
the colonel, at Southport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was my idea!” I cried, “and we’ve done
it with the greatest ease—I knew we should!—and
we’re all safe; and oh, Lucy! do just come
into the saloon and see how much we’ve got. It
was my own idea, and the fools all said it was
impossible, and just look how simple it’s been,
after all! Why, we must have carried off sixty
thousand pounds, at least!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy seemed scarcely to understand what I
was talking about; but she saw I was safe, and,
feeling the yacht well under weigh, cared for
very little else; so she held my hand and soothed
and calmed me, and then followed with obedient
laughter as I almost dragged her into the saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There, neatly piled under the electric light on
the table, lay the linen bags, for all the world like
the letter-bags in a mail-train; and there was
Brentin, with wet hair and tie all on one side,
beginning to empty them and arrange notes and
gold in separate heaps. The silver was a little
deficient, for we had given the sailors orders
more or less to ignore the five-franc pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the gallant band, Hines and Forsyth were
lying on the sofas with closed eyes, still slightly
panting; my sister was looking on, leaning up
against one of the pillars, where Miss Rybot,
seated at the table, was unfolding the notes with
her long, slim fingers, and arranging them in
bundles according to their respective values.
She was doing it with the greatest coolness, and,
for some reason, a rather more haughty air of
displeasure than usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Master Vincent,” said Brentin, looking
up at me with grim joy, “here we all are, and
here is the boodle. Come and help count.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment in came Masters. It appears
he had fallen, getting down off the railway line,
and muddied his trousers; he had been changing
them, not caring to appear before his young
lady with dirty knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hines and Forsyth roused themselves, and, almost
in silence, we sat down to count; not a
sound but a step or two on deck overhead and
the throb of the engines, the luxurious rustle of
notes, the pleasing chink of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly my sister said, “Where’s Mr. Parsons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Rybot murmured, “Two hundred and
forty-seven thousand-franc notes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked round the saloon. “Yes, by-the-way,
where’s Teddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer, and Brentin stopped
emptying the last bag. “In his cabin, probably,”
he said, carelessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he’s not,” replied Masters, who shared it
with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He came in your boat,” said Brentin, looking
across at me, startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, he didn’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was dead silence while for a moment
we looked in each other’s frightened faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I got up and left the saloon. Outside I
shouted for him; no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hurried on deck to find the captain; it was
still raining hard, and the captain was in his
shelter up on the bridge. The light from the
binnacle struck up on the resolute face of Joyce
at the wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Evans!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see Mr. Parsons come on board?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t say I particularly noticed him, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joyce, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wasn’t in our boat, was he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who rowed the second boat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bramber and Meikle, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hurried away and at last found them in the
galley with the cook, eating a surreptitious supper,
with tin plates on their knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who came in the boat with you men?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brentin, Mr. Masters, Mr. Hines, and Mr.
Forsyth,” said Bramber, with his mouth full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right!” said Meikle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You saw nothing of Mr. Parsons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; we thought he was with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I stumbled down the companion and almost
fell into the saloon. They had stopped counting
and looked up at me anxiously. “Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not on board!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sakes alive!” murmured Brentin. “That’s
awkward!—for Mr. Parsons,” he considerately
added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My sister said “Good gracious, Vincent!”
while with her silver pencil Miss Rybot began
to draw poor Teddy’s insignificant profile on the
back of one of the thousand-franc notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I took a perturbed turn or two up and down
the saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He can’t have fallen overboard?” ventured
Masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could he, if he didn’t even come off in
either of the boats?” some one replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was another pause, and then I asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How closely were you followed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, not at all,” said Brentin. “After we
loosed off the guns they all ran back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did anybody see Teddy after we got down
the steps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody answered. The fact was, I fear, we
were all too busy looking after ourselves to look
after any one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may have fallen crossing the line. Did
anybody notice whether any one fell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence again. Then, with vague emphasis,
Brentin said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Depend upon it, Mr. Parsons is ay gentleman
of so much resource that, wherever he is,
he may safely be left to extricate himself from
embarrassment. Let us resoom the counting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked at him reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brentin, it was agreed we stood by each
other, I believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were the first to get ahead, sir,” he replied,
with what was meant for withering sarcasm,
“and be off in the wrong boat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I understood we were all safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we were. So, no doubt, is Mr. Parsons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if at this moment he is in the hands of
the police?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The base Brentin shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Tong pee pour louee</span>,” he said, in New York
French. “Gentlemen, let us resoom the counting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” I cried, banging the table, “not till we
have decided what is to be done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brentin frowned and looked across at me
sourly. I couldn’t have believed success would
so utterly change a man; but so it often is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good chap, Teddy Parsons,” murmured
Forsyth. “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know, sir,” scowled Brentin,
“whether you propose to imperil the safety of
five gentlemen, three elegant and refined ladies,
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it, or was it not, understood we stood
by each other?” I cried, impatiently. “See
here, you fellows, you can’t be seriously thinking
of leaving that poor little snipe in the lurch like
this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parsons never was any particular friend of
mine,” growled Hines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, I expect he’s all right,” said Masters,
evasively. “He knows people over at Mentone;
he’ll be off over there, you bet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you excite yourself, old boy,” murmured
Forsyth. “Parsons is one of the cleverest
chaps I know. He’ll get out of it all right, you
take your oath. Besides, we can scarcely turn
back now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn back!” snarled Brentin. “This vessel
is mine and under my orders. There will be no
turning back, except over my dead body; and
that’s all there is to it! Come, gentlemen,” he
cried, impatiently, “resoom the counting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And such was their incredible baseness that
they actually began counting again, just as
though poor Teddy Parsons had never been
born. Only the ladies looked shocked, while
Lucy kept her frightened eyes fixed on my face.
As for me, my mind was soon made up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” I said, resolutely, “if you won’t any
of you come, I shall go back alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter with walking on the
waters?” sneered Brentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a few moments,” I continued, “we shall
be off Cap Martin. Mr. Brentin, you will be
good enough to give orders to have me put
ashore there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, sir!” he jeered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall make my way back to Monte Carlo
alone—<span class='it'>alone!</span>” I cried, with pathetic emphasis,
“and not rest till I have discovered what has
become of our poor lost friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you please,” said Brentin, sharply; “only
if <span class='it'>you</span> are caught you mustn’t expect any one of
us to come to your rescue. It’s simply sending
good money after bad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Lucy began to cry as, before leaving the
saloon, I turned to them and fired my parting
shot. I forget now precisely what it was, but I
know it was both dignified and touching; feeling,
as I did, rather more sorry for myself than
even for poor Teddy. But it had no effect
whatever in rousing any of them to accompany
me on my perilous journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I went back to my cabin to change my
clothes, for I was still in my smoking-suit with
the torn pocket, and, so attired, could scarcely
venture ashore. Disguise of some sort was
clearly imperative before trusting myself again
on the scene of our so recent successful labors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, most providentially, before we left London,
Brentin and I had gone off one morning to
Clarkson’s, the wig-maker. It was quite possible,
we had argued, we might have to fly, more
or less closely pursued, and for that unpleasing
eventuality had hired half a dozen wigs, among
them two gray ones, for what are known, I believe,
as “character old men.” I had at the
same time bought a pair of gray whiskers, and,
with my old regimental theatricals make-up box,
packed them away, along with a quiet, elderly
suit. I was always intrusted with the old men’s
parts in our regimental theatricals, and invariably
played them in a dress-coat, frilled shirt,
and a bunch of seals with moiré antique ribbon,
bending myself almost double and rapping with
a crook stick in a manner so natural as to deceive
even the men of my own company at the
back of the hall. So that, unless I overacted, or
a whisker came off, I felt pretty sure of not
being recognized by comparative strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quiet elderly suit I rapidly dressed myself
in, and with my mackintosh cape, an umbrella,
and the make-up box under my arm, went back
to the saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was so offended at their pusillanimity I would
look at no one but Brentin, who, with glittering
eye and long cigar, was jotting down the amounts
of our capture on a piece of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have given the necessary orders?” I
asked him, coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, sir!” he sneered. “The yacht is
now slowing down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy had gone to her cabin with my sister, in
great distress, and Miss Rybot was sitting there
with arms folded, rubbing her silver pencil between
her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Mr. Blacker,” she said, “and good
luck to you. I admire your sense of loyalty.
You are the only <span class='it'>man</span> among the party!” she was
good enough to add.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pop, pop!” jeered the irrepressible Brentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Arthur Masters turned pale, and from a generous
fear of making him feel his inferiority by
my presence, I bowed to them all in silence, and
went up on deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this time the yacht had stopped, and off the
port-beam I could just distinguish the dark
woods of Cap Martin looming. It was about
half-past eleven, and still slightly raining, though,
fortunately, quite warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy came running up, and, sobbing, threw
her arms round my neck. My sister kissed me
affectionately, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall see you at Venice, Vincent dear;
take care of yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the next minute I was over the side and
in the boat. I said never a word the whole time,
being, I confess, deeply offended at the light way
they all took my heroic resolution, and the assurance
they showed in so readily believing (however
flattering to my courage and address) it was
all bound to be successful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men rowed me ashore in silence, bade me
a respectful good-night, and I was soon clambering
over the stones and up the rough bank. Soon
I was in the comparative shelter of the woods,
and there, finding the base of a fir-tree tolerably
dry, I sat me down to think and wait for morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faintly I heard midnight strike from Monte
Carlo, and then, so absorbed in thought and conjecture
I grew, I fell asleep. When I woke, it
was just getting gray; so I rose, stretched my
stiff self, and had a good look about me. I knew
tolerably well whereabouts I was; for my sister,
Miss Rybot, Masters, and I had one day been over
Cap Martin to tea at the hotel, and walked back
through the woods, past the Empress Eugenie’s
villa, on to the Mentone road, and so home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had then noticed, not far from the villa, in
the woods, a small sort of ancient decaying gamekeeper’s
lodge, painted outside with arabesque
in the Italian manner, and faint vanishing mottoes
of conviviality and sport; and that I determined
to make for, and see if I could there secure facilities
for shaving off my mustache, at any rate.
Then I proposed to retire into the woods again,
and assume my character old man wig and whiskers,
and so disguised make my way leisurely back
into Monte Carlo, to try and find news of the
luckless Teddy. Beyond that, I could devise no
plan of any sort, determining to leave all to the
hazard of the hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wandered about a good time in the dawn,
and at last struck the lodge, soon after seven,
when it was growing tolerably light. It was a
fine morning, fortunately, though very raw and
cold. The lodge door was open, and I peeped
in. Probably, in the last century, it had been a
luncheon-house for the Grimaldis on their shooting
or pleasure expeditions; now it was rapidly
decaying, and looked like a neglected summerhouse.
No one was to be seen, and so, the foot
of a ladder showing to the upper room, I entered
and climbed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a bedroom, and evidently only just left;
the bed was tumbled, and there was the faint,
fragrant odor of a pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No time was to be lost, so I poured water into
the basin (the owner had evidently not washed
that morning) and got out my razors. I found a
pair of scissors, and clipping myself as close as
possible first and then screwing up my courage,
for shaving in cold water is horribly painful,
and lathering myself well, I set to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hadn’t more than half done when I heard
steps outside on the wet gravel; they came into
the house, to the foot of the ladder; then they
began slowly to climb. There was no help for it,
I must go on and trust to luck; so on I went with
my shaving, keeping an eye meantime in the glass
on the door behind me, so that I might gain
some impression of the owner before tackling
and conciliating him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately, when I was trying for the army,
before I failed and went into the militia, I had
been for six months with a coach at Dinan, in
Brittany, and spoke French well enough for all
vulgar purposes; so when the ordinary type of an
old soldier, <span class='it'>garde champêtre</span>, head appeared at
the head of the ladder, bristling with astonishment,
I felt more at home with it than perhaps
the ordinary British officer, who has only learned
his French at Wren’s or Scoone’s, would have
done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dîtes donc!</span>” said the amazed man; “<span class='it'>je ne
vous gêne pas?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Du tout!</span>” I replied, “<span class='it'>entrez</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais, nom d’un chien!</span>” he cried, coming into
the room. “<span class='it'>Qu’est ce que vous faites là?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Vous voyez, n’est ce pas? Je me rase.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Je le vois bien! et après?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Après? Je m’en vais.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause while the <span class='it'>garde champêtre</span>
came alongside, and surveyed me with folded
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears were in my eyes, for the process was a
torture; but I went on with it heroically and in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, “<span class='it'>Vous êtes Américain?</span>” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais oui. Toute ma vie!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est bien. J’aime les Américains.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Merci! moi aussi!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man laughed, and then he went on:
“<span class='it'>Mais, dîtes donc! Pourquoi vous rasez-vous
ici comme ça, dans ma chambre, ma propre
chambre?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est que</span>—” I hesitatingly began, and then,
with an inspired rush—“<span class='it'>voyez vous! Je suis
marié, et je crois que ma femme me trompe.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oh, la! la! Et après?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Après? Je vais me déguiser et la pincer.
C’est dur, n’est ce pas?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Très dur!</span>” said the man, looking amused;
“<span class='it'>mais les femmes sont toujours comme ça. Elle
est Américaine?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Anglaise.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Je déteste les Anglais! Continuez, mon bon
monsieur. Je vous laisse.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Merci! Dans cinq minutes je descendrai.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ne vous pressez pas, et déguisez-vous bien</span>,”
he said, and, leaving the room, went half-way
down the ladder. Then he turned and put his
head into the room again, resting his elbows on
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dîtes donc, mon bon monsieur</span>,” he said, evidently
at some pains to check his mirth; “<span class='it'>avec
qui croyez-vous que votre femme vous trompe?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Je ne sais pas au juste. Avec un de mes
amis, je crois.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Le misérable!</span>” he cried, theatrically. “<span class='it'>Un
Français, sans doute?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oui, malheureusement.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Oh, la, la! Mais les amis sont comme ça.
C’est très dur, tout de même. Courage! Je vais
préparer le café. Au revoir.</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With so sympathetic a <span class='it'>garde champêtre</span> I felt
I was in luck, and might as well seize the opportunity
for assuming my complete disguise, instead
of taking to the woods; so I put on my
wig and, with some spirit-gum, stuck on my
gray whiskers, lined my face lightly, and, in
five minutes, presented myself to the more
than ever astonished <span class='it'>garde champêtre</span> as a respectable,
well preserved, elderly gentleman of
sixty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais nom d’un chien!</span>” he cried; “<span class='it'>c’est
parfait! Elle ne vous reconnaîtra pas; jamais
de la vie!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sat down and drank the coffee, the best
friends in the world; and then, giving him a
louis and the box of make-up and razors as a
souvenir, I left him with a warm shake of the
hand, and went off through the wood to strike
the Mentone road back into Monte Carlo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hadn’t gone twenty paces before he came
running after me to say that if ever I wanted to
disguise myself again I was to come to him and
use his rooms, and that he would always keep
the razors in order for the purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais c’est dur, tout de même</span>,” he added,
sympathetically, as I promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last I saw of him, he turned and waved
his hand. “<span class='it'>Adieu, mon vieux!</span>” he cried.
“<span class='it'>Bonne chance!</span>”</p>

IN MY DISGUISE I AM MISTAKEN FOR LORD B.—A CLUB
ACQUAINTANCE—TEDDY AT THE LAW COURTS—MRS.
WINGHAM—THE DEFENCE AND THE ACQUITTAL—WE
BOLT
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Behold</span> me, then, in sexagenarian disguise,
trudging back into Monte Carlo, with my mackintosh
and umbrella. It was barely nine o’clock
in the morning when I started; and, soon after
ten, there I was standing once more in front of
the Casino buildings, out of which, but a few
hours before, I had so triumphantly rushed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange to say, there was no sign of anything
extraordinary having occurred; there were the
usual people sitting about reading the papers on
the seats round the flower-beds, the usual attendants
loafing on the steps, guarding the entrance.
Over the building flapped, as ever, the
dingy Monaco flag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first feeling was of intense annoyance
and disgust that, notwithstanding our complete
success, the nefarious business was apparently
being carried on as usual. What on earth did
it all mean? Were sixty thousand pounds as
naught to them? Were they placidly going to
put up with their loss, rather than advertise
their misfortune? or, under this apparent calm,
were there really depths of trouble and vengeance
stirring—already rising—to ingulf poor Teddy,
whom I never doubted from the first was captured,
and now shortly about to appear before
the Prince’s judges away up at Monaco, bent in
painful submission at the criminal bar!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I sat down for a few moments to consider what
should be done, and look about me for some one
to whom I could apply for trustworthy information:
what was thought of us, and what steps
the authorities proposed to take.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an old gentlemen, an Englishman,
evidently, sitting on my seat; and, as one garrulous
old person to another might, I proceeded to
try him cautiously with a few questions. Did
he know, could he tell me, at what hour the rooms
opened?</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at me over his pince-nez, and said
at twelve. Then he flipped his pince-nez off,
smiled, and, giving me a friendly look, politely
observed he believed he and I were members of
the same distinguished club, the Mausolœum.
He dared say I hadn’t forgotten dining next
him there in the autumn, and the interesting
talk we had then had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye, aye,” I mumbled, in my fright, a
mixture of Punch and Pantaloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seen me walking about before, he went
on (what on earth did he mean by that, I wondered),
and had meant to take the liberty of
speaking to me. What I had said in the autumn
had interested and impressed him very much, and
he had often thought over it. Then he folded
up his paper, and evidently began to lay himself
out for a renewal of our supposed conversation,
a prospect which much alarmed and disconcerted
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I scarcely liked to exercise the complete vigor
of my youth and make an immediate bolt; for
I had doddered up to the seat and, like an aged
pensioner, sat me down with a loud sigh of relief—rather
overacting, in fact; so, if I were to
keep up the character, I must at least dodder
away again when I left. Yet, however complimentary
to my make-up, it was, just at present,
a distinct nuisance to find myself mistaken for
somebody else, and likely to be detained over
a conversation which, under no circumstances,
could ever have had the faintest interest for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To prevent that, I cautiously began:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My servant tells me there was a robbery, or
something of that sort, in the rooms last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said my club comrade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard anything about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Casino authorities keep a thing of that
sort pretty close, I imagine,” I cautiously ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’re quite right,” the old gentleman replied.
“Quite right!” Then, after a pause, he
went on, “I suppose you never spoke to Markham
on the subject, after all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed, I didn’t,” I mumbled, making
the best reply I could under the circumstances.
“Fact is, I never saw him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, didn’t he turn up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I forget.” And then I uneasily added, “You
know what a feather-headed feller he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman laughed and said, “Somebody
ought to speak to him, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s the matter with his wife?” I
said, unconsciously, dropping into one of Brentin’s
phrases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s more than I can tell you,” the old
gentleman replied. “She’s looked like that for
a long time now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was so rapidly getting tired of this footling
talk, not to mention the fibs it entailed and the
precious time being wasted, that, at any cost, I
determined to put a stop to it; so I rose with an
effort, and saying, vaguely, “Well, I’ve got to
meet my wife; good-day to you! I dare say I
shall see you again somewhere about,” strolled
off towards the Casino steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old gentleman, who had evidently looked
forward to a long conversation, answered me
rather gruffly, “Good-day!”—while straight up
to one of the attendants at the head of the steps
I walked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, <span class='it'>monsieur</span>,” the man politely said, “the
rooms are open for play at twelve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As usual?” I pointedly observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Altogether as usual.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Notwithstanding the robbery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, as for that,” the man replied, shrugging
his shoulders, “it was a very small affair. The
miserable was caught and would be punished.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An Englishman, I understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, an Englishman. No doubt at this moment
he was being tried, and already safe in prison.
“<span class='it'>Au revoir, monsieur! à votre service, monsieur!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My legs felt fully their assumed age as I turned
and faltered down the steps. So all hope was
over; poor Teddy was really caught, and the regiment
would know him no more. Unless!—why,
what could I do?—good gracious!—</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was so deep in my own troubled thoughts
and plans, I scarcely noticed my supposed old
club friend on the seat; should not have noticed
him at all, in fact, had I not just at this moment,
when I was calling a carriage to drive up
to the “Monopôle,” come plump on the other
highly respectable elderly gentleman I evidently
so closely resembled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Face to face we met, and naturally stared at
each other. Will it be believed we were absolutely
exactly alike, down even to the cut and
color of our clothes? For the first and only
time in my life I saw myself at full length, myself
as I should be at sixty (if I only took care
of myself), sedate, healthy, a county magistrate,
member of Brooke’s, with my youngest boy just
leaving Eton. I hurried into the carriage and
told the man to drive up to the “Monopôle” as
fast as he could go, just giving a look round at
my friend on the seat as I got in. He had turned,
and, with his hands on his knees, was staring after
me, dumbfounded. My double had turned and
was staring after me too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To both those gentlemen, if they should ever
chance to read this work, I offer my sincere
apology; they will understand now the reason of
my accidental resemblance, and, as between men
of the world, will no doubt forgive it. I can
assure them both it will not occur again; how
can it, seeing that wig and whiskers are buried
under an olive-tree on the Mentone road?</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the “Monopôle”—having, of course, no
notion who I really was—they were very polite.
No, Madame Wingham was not in; they couldn’t
say where she was; a letter had come for her
early and she had gone out. Instinctively, I felt
the letter was from Teddy, imploring succor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I left the hotel at once and drove straight up
to Monaco. At the cathedral I dismissed the
carriage and walked on to the law courts. What
to do I had no idea; watch the proceedings, at
any rate, <span class='it'>incognito</span> from the back, and, at the
worst, hear with my own sad ears how much poor
Teddy got. Any thought of rescue was, of
course, out of the question. What could a poor
old person of sixty do against soldiers and gendarmes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The criminal court of Monaco sits in a bare
upper room, close to the cathedral. Outside,
steep steps of the usual <span class='it'>Palais de Justice</span> inverted
V-shape lead up to it, with, at their head, a
bare flag-pole, like a barber’s sign. Up the
steps I walked, and with beating heart (for my
own sake, I confess, as much as for poor Teddy’s)
entered the fatal, the lethal chamber. It
was very full and stuffy. News of our victory
and the capture of one of the band no doubt had
spread, for the public part was crammed, tightly
as sardines and garlic. Facing, under a crucifix,
from over which the dingy green curtain was
drawn, sat three judges; three real judges, in
their bands and toques and ermine! Common
white bedroom blinds scarcely kept the sun out,
streaming in mistily on the members of the bar
in beards and gowns, on the <span class='it'>greffier</span> busily writing,
and the usher waiting to summon the luckless
Parsons to the dock. Just at present the
judges were bending the weight of their intellects
on a couple of market-women charged with
fighting; and there, tightly wedged against the
partition, stood the forlorn Mrs. Wingham, a
handkerchief in her black kid grasp, bending
and talking tearfully to the barrister seated below,
whom she apparently had engaged for the
defence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made my way to her and pulled her sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come outside,” I whispered; “it’s I—hush!—Vincent
Blacker.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at me, and then at last followed
obediently to the door. We stood outside at the
head of the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got him, I suppose?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you cowards!” she gasped, “to run
away and leave him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that now,” I answered; “<span class='it'>I</span> have
come back, at any rate. Let us consider what can
be done. You’ve got some one to defend him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the man talks such horrible French, I
can’t understand a word he says,” she moaned,
“and he reeks of garlic. And where’s my brother,
James Thompson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all right,” I evasively replied. “Never
mind him just now. We must really concentrate
ourselves on doing something for poor
Teddy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I dare say! Now you mind this, young
man!” cried Mrs. Wingham, with sudden vindictiveness.
“If he goes to prison you go, too!
I won’t ’ear of his going alone. I’ll shout to the
police! I’ll ’ave you arrested! He sha’n’t be
the only one to suffer, poor young lamb!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hair under my wig stood up on end, and
even my false whiskers stiffened. The old woman
was quite capable of executing her threat,
and for a moment I felt, not sixty, but a hundred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outwardly, however, I was calm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Desperate cases require desperate remedies,”
I judicially observed. “Take my arm and let
us return to court. We’ll adopt our own line of
defence. Come along, ma’am, and for the present
kindly remember I am your husband and my
name is Wingham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vicious old woman held me so tightly, I
knew that if Teddy went under and were condemned
she meant me to go under, too. Together
we wedged our way to the partition, just
above our odoriferous barrister. I was bending
to speak to him when suddenly a bell was rung
and Teddy was immediately ushered, nay, thrust,
in, between a couple of gendarmes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor chap, he was almost unrecognizable, he
had been so roughly handled. His smoking-suit
was torn, and round his neck, in place of
collar and tie, he had knotted a handkerchief,
coster fashion; but what mostly disguised and
disfigured him was his gashed and puffed face;
for in falling down the steps he had fallen plump
on a bunch of cactus, scoring him as though he
had been mauled by an angry tigress. He never
had been pretty, but now he looked exactly like
the malefactor that, in the eye of the law, at
any rate, I suppose he really was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just look at his face!” gasped Mrs.
Wingham. “Oh, the poor creature!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” I whispered; “for goodness’ sake
keep calm. And kindly remember he’s our
nephew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I judged it wisest to hear the evidence against
him before considering the line we should take in
his defence. I contented myself for the present
with whispering to our counsel that the prisoner
was our nephew, his arrest a complete mistake,
and he himself as innocent of any attempt at
robbery as the newly born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime, in French fashion, the President
of the Court—a robust old man with a white
beard and a red face, like a neatly trimmed
Father Christmas—after reading the act of accusation,
was the first to tackle and brow-beat
our unfortunate friend. To do him justice,
Teddy kept beautifully cool (he says now he
recognized me and my wink through the disguise,
and knew he was safe) and answered nothing
through his puffed mouth but <span class='it'>Nong!</span> and <span class='it'>Jammy!</span>
Every now and then the President, in
the politest manner in the world, observed,
“<span class='it'>Vous mentez, jeune homme!</span>” or “<span class='it'>C’est faux!</span>”
while the judge on his right, a battered little
man with blue glasses and his mouth all fallen
in, ejaculated “<span class='it'>Quelle effronterie!</span>” or “<span class='it'>C’est
abominable!</span>” at intervals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, the evidence against him
(according to our English notions, at any rate)
was far from strong. There were croupiers
present ready to swear to having seen him in
the rooms, charging down on the tables with a
revolver; there were the men from the door to
swear they had noticed him rush past; and there
were the firemen who had found him crawling
away behind the signal-box, down on the line,
after we had got clear away. Very good. But
the cactus had, for the present, so disfigured
him, that an adroit cross-examination could not
fail very much to shake them, and that, no
doubt, the President felt; for, after wrangling
with Teddy for some time, and receiving nothing
but an eruption of <span class='it'>Nongs</span> and <span class='it'>Jammys</span> for his
pains, he ill-temperedly cried identification would
be useless and unfair with the accused’s face in
its present condition, and that, until the swelling
disappeared, he should remand him; by which
time, he sardonically added, he had no doubt
the other malefactors would be before him in a
row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy gave me a piteous glance, and, nerving
myself, I nudged our barrister, whom all along I
had been coaching, and up he got.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, most fortunately, when poor Teddy was
caught, neither revolver nor spoil were found on
him; spoil he had never had, and the revolver,
after the final discharge, he had hurled over the
embankment into the sea. And he had always
told the same story: that he had truly enough
been in the rooms, but had nothing whatever to
do with the robbery, having been forced out in
the disturbance, and run as the others had;
running, in his alarm, he knew not where, until
he fell down the steps, lost his senses, and, coming
to, found himself in the hands of the police.
He was a quiet, respectable young Englishman,
he declared, come to Monte Carlo for his health,
and staying with his aunt at the hotel “Monopôle,”
to whom (as I thought) he had early despatched
a note, announcing himself as her nephew
and in trouble, and imploring help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here we were to claim him, after so unpleasant
an experience, Milor and Madame Ving-ham—so
the barrister announced us!—persons
of the highest consideration and wealth, constant
visitors on the shores of the hospitable
Riviera; in short, this, that, and the other, all
couched in the finest language, and none of it
in the least true. And then, in a final peroration,
amid murmurs of sympathy, culminating
in a burst of applause, the barrister threw up
his fat hands, and invoked justice, mercy, and
international law (not to mention the hospitality
of old Greece and Rome), and, sitting down,
wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his gown;
while Madame Ving-ham judiciously lifted up
her troubled voice, and wept louder than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the emotion had subsided, the President
called me forward, and for the second time
that morning my unlucky resemblance to another
gentleman (a nobleman, by-the-way, as it
turned out) was likely to get me into further
trouble; for in me, Vincent Blacker, disguised
as an old boy of sixty, the President imagined
he recognized, just as my club friend had done
an hour before, a distinguished guest he had
met the previous evening at the Prince’s table;
with whom he had held an improving discussion
as to the present unsatisfactory condition of the
British House of Lords, and the best method of
amending, without destroying it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Comment, Milor!</span>” he cried, in astonishment,
looking at me over his glasses; “<span class='it'>c’est votre Seigneurie?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good Lord, I said to myself, here we are again—giving
the old man a polite but alarmed bow
and smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the President knew me as Milor B., he
ventured to observe (I really don’t quite like to
give the illustrious name), and here was our advocate
announcing me as some one else!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hastened to explain, with perspiration on my
brow, that Ving-ham was my second title, and in
an unfortunate affair of this kind—<span class='it'>Cour d’Assises</span>,
in short—I did not care for my first to be
publicly mixed up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The President bowed and said that was well
understood, and then he proceeded to put me
a few exceedingly polite and fatuous questions
about Teddy, who, as a contrite nephew cut to
the heart at so unfortunately dragging an old
and honored name through the purlieus of the
criminal law, was acting his part to perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, monsieur was my nephew, of a character
gentle and affectionate; of retiring habits and
delicate health, a little <span class='it'>poitrinaire</span>, in fact (at
which Teddy, comprehending, coughed with unnecessary
violence), but all that was of obedient,
tractable, and good. He had gone down to the
Casino, while we, my wife and I—Madame Ving-ham
still weeping—had gone to bed, believing
he was in his room; and the next we had heard
was early that morning, when we received a note
from him announcing the unfortunate capture
and mistake. <span class='it'>Monsieur le Président</span> would readily
understand what of grief and desolation?—my
affectionate uncle’s voice, with a touch of
an only nephew in it, trembled, and madame
shook convulsively as, still grasping my arm
tight, she moaned and sobbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was more than enough. In a very few
minutes, after a brief consultation among the
judges, Teddy was released and dramatically
embracing us in the body of the court—thereby
nearly bringing off my left whisker—and I was
paying our eloquent counsel. Before I left the
yacht I had providentially provided myself with
a bundle of notes from the heap of spoil on the
table, and one of them—for a thousand francs—I
presented to the astonished and gratified barrister.
I trembled to think how much more than
ever for the next few days he would reek of his
favorite <span class='it'>ail</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out went Mrs. Wingham, arm in arm with
Teddy, and I followed, after declining the President’s
kind invitation to breakfast with him, on
the score of my overwrought feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as I was going down the steps a man I
recognized as a croupier touched me respectfully
on the arm, with a crafty, meridional smile. I
stopped in some alarm, thinking it possible I was
discovered. What did he want? Why, Milor
no doubt remembered that lady whom Milor
had commissioned the croupier to find out all
about and let him know? Perfectly, I replied,
with stiff and aristocratic upper lip. What had
he discovered?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was an Italian, one Madame Vagliano,
and she lived at the Villa des Genets, above the
Condamine. He was proceeding with more information,
when I haughtily cut him short with
“<span class='it'>C’est bien! assez! voici madame qui nous observe</span>,”
and handing him a note, which I afterwards
discovered was unfortunately one of a
thousand francs instead of, as I meant, a hundred,
I hurried to the foot of the steps, where
madame and Teddy were awaiting me. <span class='it'>Ce
scélèrat de Lord B.!</span> I have really a good mind
to give his illustrious name, after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We walked on a little way in silence, and then
Mrs. Wingham said, with traces of tearfulness:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you two villains going to do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bolt!” I replied, laconically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where’s my poor brother James all this
time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all right, enjoying himself first-rate,
sailing about somewhere in the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A well-appointed steam-yacht, belonging to
a friend of ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You thieving wretches! You’ve been and
decoyed him on board, you know you ’ave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he’s perfectly safe, wherever he is.
Come along, Teddy, there’s no time to be lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I can’t go like this,” cried Teddy. “I
haven’t even got a hat, and all my clothes are
on the yacht.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We bought him a dreadful French straw-hat
up in Monaco, and then we jumped into a carriage
and drove down to the tailor’s, next the
“Grand Hotel.” As we drove, I questioned Mrs.
Wingham as to what was known and said in the
town about our escapade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” said Mrs. Wingham, “people have
been terribly frightened, and are beginning to
leave the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! And what line are the authorities
taking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are denying it all, right and left, but
they are determined to catch you, all the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can’t do both!” I coldly replied.
“They’d much better put up with their loss;
we shall put the money to much better use than
they could ever have done. If they are going to
make themselves unpleasant over it, you may tell
them from me we’ll come back and do precisely
the same thing next year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You impudent young feller!” cried the angry
old woman, “you forget that one of the sharpest
detectives in England is after you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s taking a mighty circuitous route!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’ll catch you, all the same, at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will he?” I answered, eying her with cold
amusement. “Now look here, missus, if you say
much more I’ll communicate with Van Ginkel, and
direct him to take the yacht across to Cuba and
have James landed and shot there as a filibuster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon the poor old soul fell to whimpering
again, though at the same time she couldn’t
help laughing a little at my readiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy was soon fitted out at the tailor’s, and
a sight he looked in what they called the <span class='it'>dernier
cri</span> of a French travelling costume; more like a
young man out of the <span class='it'>Petit Journal pour rire</span>
than anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Adieu, Madame Ving-ham!” I laughed, as
we got outside. “Your nephew and I are going
to get bicycles and be off down the Corniche,
over the Italian frontier. Say good-bye to him,
and be off home to Brixton yourself as soon as
possible, or you may get into trouble with the
police here for using a false title of nobility.
Now, you did, you know! it’s no use your denying
it. Take my advice; the quieter you keep
for the next few months the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was so angry she wouldn’t say good-bye to
me, but she overwhelmed poor Parsons. And
she implored him as soon as possible to give up
my desperate bad company, which, sooner or
later, could only bring him to ruin—I, if you
please, who at so much risk had just rescued
him!—and to write to her soon to Brixton, and
come and see her directly he got back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood watching us as we went off to the
bicycle man’s in the Arcade, near Ciro’s, and
kept on waving her handkerchief till we got into
the gardens across the road and were lost to
view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let this be a lesson to you, my son,” I
sagely observed, as we hurried along, “always to
make yourself pleasant and polite to old ladies.
But for Mrs. Wingham, you might have been
dragging a cannon-ball at your ankle for years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Teddy shuddered, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a blessing I resembled her nephew!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And mine!” I added. “Don’t forget me.”</p>

<div class='summary'>
OUR FLIGHT TO VENICE—THENCE TO ATHENS—WE ALL
MEET ON THE ACROPOLIS—REAPPEARANCE OF MR.
BAILEY THOMPSON!—AGAIN WE MANAGE TO PUT HIM
OFF THE SCENT
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Of</span> our flight down the Corniche and across
the Italian frontier I do not propose to say
much. Suffice it that, at a quiet spot before we
reached Mentone, I found the opportunity to
strip off my disguise and, for precaution’s sake,
bury both wig and whiskers at the root of an
olive-tree; where no doubt they still remain, if
any one cares to go and look for them. In well
under the hour, so fast we travelled, we were
over the Italian border, just beyond Mentone,
and, after the usual difficulties with the <span class='it'>dogana</span>
about our bicycles, were before very long safely
seated in the Ventimiglia train for Turin. To
avoid being further troubled with the machines,
we presented them to a couple of porters, and,
while waiting for the train, passed a highly
amusing half-hour watching them trying to learn
to ride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our point was Venice, and, travelling all night,
on the afternoon of the next day (Sunday, January
19th) Teddy and I were glad to find ourselves
in a gondola, flapping along to the “Grand
Hotel,” where we were all to meet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at the “Grand” there was a telegram
awaiting me: “<span class='it'>Come Athens—Brentin.</span>” It had
been sent from Messina the previous afternoon,
and, disagreeable though it was, there was nothing
for it but to obey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went off at once to Cook’s offices in the
Piazza to inquire about a steamer; but, being
Sunday, of course found them closed. Very
awkward! Surely, nowadays, when they open
the museums, Mr. Cook might stretch a point
and do the same with his offices?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What on earth were we to do? It was evident
they didn’t care about receiving us at the hotel;
I was exceedingly dirty, with the remains of the
spirit-gum on my cheeks and the lines of the old-age
pencil alongside my nose; and poor Teddy’s
puffs and scars were all the more noticeable
now they were just beginning to heal. We
looked, in short, like a couple of broken-down
sea-side entertainers, who had had a row at the
last hall about returning the money. We had no
luggage, not even a sponge-bag, and I had talked
grandly about the yacht until I found the telegram,
when I had to admit it wasn’t coming; at
which the manager had merely bowed with sour
and silent politeness. “Then you don’t stay
here!” I read as plainly as possible in his watchful
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went on down to the Piazzetta, to the harbor
side, to see if we could by chance hear of a
vessel sailing for Athens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” grumbled Teddy, “and when we get
to Athens we shall find another wire, with
‘<span class='it'>Come Timbuctoo!</span>’ Let’s cut it short and go
home by rail. I don’t feel safe in these foreign
parts. Oh, how glad I shall be to get back to
Southport again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strolling up and down Lord Street, eh? in
those eternal breeches and gaiters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, why not? Come, let’s be off. I don’t
know why we need follow them half over Europe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, let’s be off,” said I, “if you don’t
mind paying for the tickets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you don’t mean to say you haven’t got
enough money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was true, I hadn’t. What with the thousand
francs for the defence, the thousand for
the croupier who told me about Madame Vagliano
(what the deuce did I care about Madame
Vagliano!), the buying of the bicycles, the clothes
for Teddy, the tickets, and one thing and another,
I had only two or three hundred francs left;
and Teddy had merely a couple of louis, having
spent the rest in bribing the Monte Carlo police
to carry his letter to Mrs. Wingham and put him
in a better cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing, I think, tries a man’s nature more
truly than travelling and the contretemps arising
therefrom; nothing more surely discovers
his selfishness, his meanness, his want of even
temper. We were certainly rather in a fix, but
scarcely to warrant Teddy’s outburst of anger and
ill-humor. If I was amused at it all and kept
my equanimity, why couldn’t he? But no! he
kept on fuming and fretting to such a degree
that I was within an ace of decoying him up a
piccolo canal and beating him soundly about the
head and ears, so much did he grate upon my
nerves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last we did manage to secure passages in a
dirty Italian boat, <span class='it'>Il Principe Umberto</span>, sailing
that night down the coast to Ancona and Brindisi,
and thence across the Adriatic, <span class='it'>viâ</span> Corfu,
to Patras. It was rather a tight fit, financially
speaking, for after paying for our berths and allowing
something for food on board, we had only
just about enough left for the tickets from Patras
to Athens. If the yacht didn’t turn up there,
then we should be in a fix indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We went back to the hotel, and, ordering dinner,
spent the time till it was ready in the reading-room.
There were no London papers, of
course, of Saturday’s date, but there were plenty
of French and Italian. Most of them had a paragraph
about us and our doings, very guardedly
expressed. None of them went further than
merely saying there had been an audacious attempt
at robbery in the rooms at Monte Carlo
on Friday night, and much excitement in consequence;
but without exception they hastened
to add that all connected with it were in the
hands of the police, tranquillity reigned, and play
was going on as usual. Teddy and I pointed
each other out the paragraphs as we found them,
and chuckled over them amazingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the voyage I draw a veil; enough that it
was exceedingly rough and uncomfortable, and we
were both very unwell, as somehow one always
is if one has to go second class. My only consolation
lay in occasionally seeing an extremely good-looking
Italian stewardess, who looked in on us
every now and then, and sympathetically said
“<span class='it'>Male?</span>” I never answered her; I don’t know
a word of Italian, and I couldn’t have said it if
I had; but it was something occasionally to see
her fine, serious, handsome face, shining in over
our deathliness like a star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Corfu we managed to drag ourselves ashore
for a couple of hours, and mooned about arm-in-arm,
in unsteady rapture at the warmth and sunshine.
At the hotel where we lunched we found
the English papers. One of them (that hebetated
old ——, I think it was) had “Extraordinary
Story from Monte Carlo” among its foreign
intelligence—just a few lines, to say an attempt
had been made by some Americans to raid the
rooms, that it had been completely frustrated, so
far as plunder was concerned, but the desperadoes
had got clear away in a yacht known as the <span class='it'>Saratoga</span>.
And that, so far as I could ever afterwards
learn, was the only reference to our affair in the
whole of the English press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the <span class='it'>New York Guardian</span>, they declared
the thieves were all English, many of them well-known
in New York, where the season before they
had masqueraded as peers and peers’ sons, and
some of them nearly succeeded in marrying prominent
and wealthy society young ladies. Really,
when one happens to be a little behind the
scenes, one is amazed at the pompous inaccuracy
of much of the information in the newspapers.
But, on the whole, I thought it wisest not to
write and attempt to put them straight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the Wednesday morning, early, we reached
Patras, and were in Athens soon after six. We
drove up to the best hotel, but there was no news
whatever of the yacht. We had been so unwell,
for after leaving Corfu it again became fearfully
rough, we looked more disreputable than ever.
It was no time, however, to be scrupulous, and
I carried matters with such a high hand, and was
so dissatisfied and overbearing, we soon got rooms,
dined, and went to bed. I have always noticed,
by-the-way, that if you are rude and give yourself
airs of importance, even without luggage,
you can generally get what you want in the way of
accommodation. Most people think you wouldn’t
swagger or be insolent unless you were really
somebody, and either get out of the way and let
you take what you want, or give it you, bent
double with obsequiousness. But, then, most
people are fools. So Teddy and I got two of the
best bedrooms, after totally refusing others, and
slept in them with great comfort and soundness;
though all the money we had between us was
seven francs fifty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning, soon after breakfast, we went
up to the Acropolis. From my school-days I
knew it commanded a fine view, and hoped from
thence soon to descry the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>’Οιμοι! there wasn’t a sign of her. We could
look right down into the harbor of the Piræus,
three or four miles away, and the only occupants
were a Greek man-of-war and a couple of trading
brigs. To comfort Teddy, I pointed him out
various famous islands—Salamis and Aegina, and
so forth—telling him such stories from Greek
history as I could remember, or partially invent.
In the Acropolis itself, wandering among the
splendid and touching ruins, there wasn’t a soul
but a dirty man, with large patches on his knees,
gathering snails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He follows the footsteps of Pericles, of Alcibiades,
and of Solon,” I said, “and from their
dim traces he gathers snails for soup. Such, my
dear Teddy,” I added, tranquilly, “is all the history
he knows. To him the Acropolis is nothing
but a hunting-ground for snails.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re talking exactly like Mr. Barlow!” replied
Teddy, with a dissatisfied snort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the afternoon we again set out for the Acropolis.
At the bottom of the sacred ascent a couple
of carriages were waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It can scarcely be they,” I said. “They
would come round and try all the hotels first,
surely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a man like Brentin would do anything!”
Teddy cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I looked into the first carriage, and soon recognized
a little, rather old, cloak Lucy used to
wear, with a high Medici collar. She never had
much money for her clothes, poor child, and was
apt to be a little behind the fashions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s really they, Teddy,” I said. “Come along
and we’ll give them a fright. They deserve it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do, indeed!” shouted Teddy, scarlet
with rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We peeped in cautiously at the entrance, and
there they were. We could see them all crossing
from the Parthenon towards the Erechtheum,
headed by that toad Brentin. We let them get
well inside the walls of the beautiful little temple,
and then we went quickly across to the left towards
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as we got up to the white marble walls, I
pushed Teddy and said, “Hide.” Then I went
on in alone. Brentin was just saying, “This is
apparently the Erechtheum. There’s mighty
little of it left; why don’t they put it straight,
anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You should just have seen their faces when
they turned and saw me. Lucy, who was looking
very pale, ran tottering towards me with a
little cry, and nearly fainted in my arms. My
sister followed, and was soon on my other shoulder.
Miss Rybot waved her parasol, Forsyth
and Hines cheered, and Arthur Masters gave a
loud <span class='it'>gone away</span>! All Brentin said was, with rather
a forced smile, “Well, all right, eh? Here
you are. You got my telegram?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sat down on the fallen blocks of marble,
and everybody began talking at once. Where
was Teddy, they asked, and why wasn’t he with
me? Had he really been caught, or had he, after
all, run straight away home in his fright?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As if trying to avoid a painful subject, “Why
didn’t you come to Venice, as we arranged?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We heard the French corvette was somewhere
up in those waters,” Brentin replied, “and thought
it safer not. We should have come to look for
you here <span class='it'>at</span> once, only we calculated you couldn’t
possibly arrive till to-morrow. But what about
Parsons? What’s the matter with your telling
us all about Parsons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Teddy!” I sighed, and everybody looked
shocked. I had scarcely made up my mind whether
to say he was dead, or in prison for life, when
Teddy himself suddenly fell in among us on his
hands and knees. He looked so ghastly, with
his white face and red cactus scars—to say nothing
of his extraordinary way of entering—that
the ladies began to scream, and Bob Hines fell
over backward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Teddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Hush! Hush!” hissed Teddy.
“Bailey Thompson!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Im-pawsible,” snarled Brentin. “He’s in
Minorca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say it’s Bailey Thompson. I saw him from
outside, just coming in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Keep quiet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We all huddled close together and kept as still
as death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t be mistaken,” Teddy whispered.
“He’s got on the same clothes and carrying the
shawl, and he was looking about him, just as he
used at Monte Carlo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say!” said Brentin, looking scared.
“What the plague is he doing in Athens? We
shall have all our trouble over again.” And
then, thinking he was not very polite, he added,
“And how are you? All right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No thanks to you!” grunted Teddy, at which
the unfeeling Brentin began to chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somebody’s scratched your face well for you,”
he laughed. “Looks like marriage lines!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We lay very still, hoping against hope Thompson
wouldn’t think the Erechtheum worth a visit;
but the fact was he had looked in the carriages
outside and questioned the driver, and, from the
cloaks and what the man had said, made up his
mind it was our party. So, after peeping in at
the Parthenon, he came straight across; we heard
his footsteps, the divisional tread, closer and
closer. Then he tumbled over a column, swore,
and the next moment was inside surveying us,
huddled together like a covey of partridges,
with an expression I don’t find it at all easy
to describe—it was such a mixture of everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor creature, he had evidently suffered! His
face was drawn, his beard unshaved, and his forlorn
eyes looked defiantly out from under a
heavily lined brow. His mouth was tight and
grim, and yet about the compressed lips there
was an air of satisfaction, almost of unholy
mirth. When he saw us, ran his glance over us
and noted we were all there, netted for the
fowler, flame leaped to his sombre eyes. There
was dead silence while he stepped majestically,
solemnly forward, threw his plaid shawl on a
column, and unbuttoned his dusty frock-coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how are you?” said Brentin, coolly.
“Come to see over the Acropolis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson glared at him, and without replying
sat down on his shawl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you get here? Had a good voyage?
Sakes alive, man, what a hole in your boot!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor man!” whispered Lucy, “how fearfully
tired and ill he looks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At so unexpected an expression of sympathy,
the detective’s expression suddenly changed.
Poor wretch, he was worn out, hungry, and depressed;
humiliated and miserable, I suppose,
at being so egregiously outwitted; for his lip
trembled, and, putting his face in his dog-skin
hands, he actually began to cry. I never felt so
ashamed of myself, so sorry for a man, in my
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cry, baby, cry!” taunted Brentin. “Serve
you thundering well right—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be quiet!” I sternly cried. Brentin scowled
at me, while poor Thompson began to search
with blinking eyes for his handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I went on, with real feeling in my
voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are sorry, Mr. Thompson, for the way
we have treated you, but you must see there was
no other course open to us. We were entirely
frank with you, but you were never frank with
us. We discovered your identity quite by accident,
and took the advantage we thought our
due of the discovery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, all right, sir, thank you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At any rate,” struck in the irrepressible
Brentin, with a wink at me, “you have the satisfaction
of knowing you spoiled a fine piece of
work, which will now, I guess, be consummated
by other more imperfect hands than ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” said the detective, brightening.
“You never even made the attempt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you take us for?” cried the ingenious
and evasive Brentin. “Make an attempt
of that nature, with the sharpest detective in
old England on our heels? No, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson looked pleased, and then, with sly
malice, observed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, after all, gentlemen, you might have
done it with perfect safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the most perfect safety, I assure you.
I had not yet communicated with the Monte
Carlo police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so? But afterwards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, afterwards, I should have pinched you
all, of course!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are!” cried Brentin; “we knew
that, mighty well. No, sir! There are no
flies on us. You gave us a fright, Mr. Bailey
Thompson, and we, I guess, have given you one.
But no real damage has been done to either
party. Let us cry quits. Your hand, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The simple fellow shook his hand obediently,
and, polite as ever, bowed to the ladies. My sister
he already knew. She smiled at him and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how on earth have you got here, Mr.
Bailey Thompson? We all understood you were
going to the Balearic Isles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nothing of my original destination,
madam,” the detective replied. “I only know
that after steaming for some few hours in one
direction, Mr. Van Ginkel suddenly bouted ship
and went full speed in the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some matter, I understood from the captain,
connected with his divorced wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Princess Danleno,” said Brentin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some such name. She had left Cannes and
gone to San Remo, and Mr. Van Ginkel was
anxious to see her and effect a reconciliation, so
the captain told me. He is full of caprice, like
all invalids, and on the caprice seizing him he
simply bouted ship without a word. But first
he had to get rid of me; so he carried me, full
speed ahead, to the southernmost point of
Greece—somewhere near Cape Colonna, I believe—and
there he carted me ashore, gentlemen,
like a sack of coals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor man’s lip began to tremble again,
and he looked round our circle piteously for
sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear! dear!” murmured Brentin; “how
like him! And never said a word the whole
time, I dare say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not one! That was early on Monday morning.
Since then I have been slowly making my
way up the Morea with great difficulty and discomfort,
mainly on foot, and sometimes getting
a lift in a country wagon. At Nauplia I managed
to secure a passage in a coasting steamer,
which, after a tempestuous voyage, has just landed
me at the Piræus. There I saw your yacht,
gentlemen, and knew, of course, you were in the
neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you manage about the language in
the Peloponnese?” asked Hines, curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, fortunately, I can draw a little,” replied
the detective, who was every moment recovering
his spirits, “and anything I wanted I drew.
But, often as I drew a beefsteak or a chop, gentlemen,”
he said, plaintively, “I never got it.
Nothing but eggs and a sort of polenta, and once—only
once—goat’s flesh, when I drew a bedstead,
in token that I wanted to sleep there.
And the fleas, gentlemen, the fleas!” he cried.
“There is a large Greek flea—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that just now,” said Brentin,
gravely. “There are elegant and refined ladies
present. The essential is you are safe, and bear
us all no malice. That is so, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None in the world!” cried the good fellow.
“But I shall be much obliged if you will give
me directions how to get home from the Acropolis
in Athens to Brixton. I have no money to
speak of, and a large hole in my right boot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be all right, sir,” said Brentin,
rising, with his grand air. “Henceforth you
are our guest. By-gones are by-gones, and we
will look after you till you are safely landed at
Charing Cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thence, by tram or ’bus, over Westminster
Bridge,” murmured Hines, as we all rose, shook
ourselves, and prepared to descend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all’s well that ends well,” cried Thompson.
“But, all the same, I rather regret, for all
our sakes, the Monte Carlo business was left
untried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some other day, sir,” said Brentin; “some
other day, when you are enjoying your well-earned
retirement, and an officer not quite so plaguy
sharp is in your place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pleased detective walked jauntily on in
front with the rest, while Brentin, my sister, and
I followed, Lucy clinging fondly to my arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what are you going to do with him?” I
whispered. “It is ingenious to let him suppose
the thing has not been done; but once he gets
on board the yacht he’s bound to discover all,
and that he’s been fooled again. Then it will
be all up, indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of you must take him home overland,
on the pretence there isn’t room for every one on
the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he must find it all out directly he gets
to England, mustn’t he?” said Lucy, softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope to goodness he won’t come trooping
over to Medworth Square,” my sister observed.
“I shall never hear the last of it from Frank.
And, after all, I’ve done nothing, have I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, O queen!” muttered Brentin, knitting
his brows. “But by the time he gets back
the scent will be fairly cold. And the Casino
authorities are taking the sensible course of
ignoring the whole affair. That is so, isn’t it?
No doubt, you’ve seen the papers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, I said, I had, and that was their line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are, then! For the rest, we
must simply trust our luck. It has stood by us
pretty well so far. Oh, and, by-the-way, what
about Mr. Parsons? How did you manage to
get him out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I rapidly sketched my part in the affair, and
made them all laugh amazingly as I told them
of my disguise and its accidental resemblance to
Lord B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether we are drunken men or fools,”
laughed Brentin, “I know not; but Providence
has certainly looked after us so far in a way
that I may fairly call the most favored nation
clause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Quoti moris minus est, eo minus est periculi!</span>”
I quoted, somehow happening to remember the
sentence from my old Latin grammar. “Which
is the Latin, ladies, for ‘Where there is the less
fear, there is the less danger.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy pressed my arm and smiled happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as we neared the carriages:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By-the-way,” I asked, “what did it all tote
up to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boodle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just over one million four hundred and fifty
thousand francs; roughly speaking, fifty-eight
thousand pounds of your money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be back in Wharton Park, dearest,” I
whispered, “before the swallow dares!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pressed my arm again and smiled more
happily than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only thing that troubles me,” said my
sister, “is how on earth I am to establish an
<span class='it'>alibi</span> to Frank’s satisfaction, in case there’s a
rumpus when we get back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Alibis</span> are old-fashioned nowadays,” I answered.
“We shall have to think of something
else for you than an <span class='it'>alibi</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unsuspicious Bailey Thompson was standing
at one of the carriage doors in a dandified
attitude, making himself agreeable to Miss
Rybot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we drove away he again said—for after all
he was human and meant to be malicious—“But
I do really wonder you didn’t do it, gentlemen,
after all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t torture us with remorse, Mr. Bailey
Thompson, sir,” Brentin cried; “the sense of
neglected opportunity is hard to bear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all I can say is, I never saw an easier
bit of work in my life, and in my absence you
were really perfectly safe. Those French police
are such utter fools, and as likely as not the
Casino people would have let you off. Come,
now, confess! Don’t you regret it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said Brentin, loftily, “I regret nothing,
and never did. All is for the best in the
best of all possible worlds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the good detective couldn’t understand
why, a few moments later, Brentin was seized
with a great roar of laughter. He explained it
was from seeing “Κοῦκ” in Greek letters over
Cook’s offices; it looked so droll! We all
laughed heartily, too, and so drove up in immense
mirth and spirits to our hotel.</p>

<div class='summary'>
WE ARRIVE SAFE IN LONDON AND GO TO MEDWORTH
SQUARE—BACK AT “THE FRENCH HORN”—NEWS AT
LAST OF THE <span class='it'>AMARANTH</span>—I INTERVIEW MR. CRAGE AND
FIND HIM ILL
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Very</span> little remains to tell; but that little is
of importance. Of our journey home together
(my sister, Lucy, Bailey Thompson, Parsons, and
I, the others sailing on board the yacht) I need
say nothing, for it was entirely pleasant and
uneventful. Our luggage wasn’t even robbed
on the Italian lines; we felt the cold somewhat
as we neared home, and that was all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Charing Cross Thompson was evidently
well-known to the officials; he proclaimed us all
his friends and above suspicion, so our portmanteaus
were barely looked at; everybody touched
their hats to him, and we felt quite royal in our
immunities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There we parted. Teddy jumped into a cab
for Euston, to catch the night express for his
dear Southport; my sister, Lucy, and I went off
in a four-wheeler to Medworth Square; while
the still unsuspicious Thompson remained on
the platform, bowing and smiling. Once safely
landed at Charing Cross, our duty to him was
plainly at an end. No doubt he would immediately
go off to Brixton, find his sister, Mrs.
Wingham, and learn the truth; but what that
might mean to us I really neither knew nor
cared. We had so far so brilliantly succeeded
that readers must not blame me if I continued
obstinately optimistic, and believed, whatever
trouble might still be in store for us, we should
certainly somehow emerge from it scathless and
joyous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope,” my sister said, as we drove away,
“he won’t think it rude of me not asking him to
come and call. After all, he’s not quite of our
world, and he would need such a deal of explaining,
for Frank always insists on knowing exactly
who everybody is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He won’t think of coming of his own accord,
I suppose?” whispered Lucy. “And, oh! I do
so wish he wasn’t a friend of Mr. Crage’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lor’ bless you!” I philosophically remarked,
“it’s even money we none of us ever see or hear
of him again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we did, that day week exactly, when he
turned up at “The French Horn,” purple with
ineffective rage, accompanied by his dazed French
<span class='it'>confrère</span>, Monsieur Cochefort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Medworth Square all was as usual. The
Thursday evening German band was playing the
usual selection from that tiresome old “Mikado,”
and my sweet niece Mollie was soon tearing
down the stairs to welcome us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She watch for you every night, ma’am,” her
Welsh nurse said; “and last night she go down-stairs
her best, and blow up Mr. Blyth like anything
for doing a door-bell ring exactly like
yours, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My brother-in-law was very glad to get his
wife back, and, having been warned by letter,
welcomed my dear Lucy with sufficient warmth.
How could he help it? Everywhere she went
she won all hearts. Brentin and Parsons both
admired her desperately, and Bob Hines, my
sister told me, paid her more attention on the
yacht coming from Monte Carlo than he had
ever been known to pay any one before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Forsyth, who is one of the most <span class='it'>difficile</span>
men I know (unless the young lady makes a dead
set at him, when he thinks her lovely), even he
said to me, “That’s a real pretty girl, Vincent,
and you’re a very lucky man to get her;” while
Miss Rybot once quite surprised me by the
warmth of her congratulation. “She’s so fresh
and unaffected, Mr. Blacker,” she said. “She’s
like a breeze that meets you at the end of a
country lane when you come suddenly upon the
sea.” Which I thought both poetical and perfectly
true—rather a rare combination nowadays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning Lucy and I were off to Liverpool
Street for Nesshaven and “The French
Horn.” As we drove up, and I saw the familiar
place once more, blinking in the soft February
sunshine, just as we had left it, I could scarcely
believe all I had gone through in the way of
peril and adventure. Somehow, if one leaves a
place for a time, and has experiences of moment
in the interval, one expects those experiences to
have had their effect elsewhere, too, even on inanimate
objects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt older, wiser, more developed, more of a
man, and I was astonished to find the place quite
unaltered and Mr. Thatcher looking just the
same as he came running out in his dirty old
blazer. His mother was at the window, gazing
through the panes with the naïve curiosity of a
child at new arrivals. She kissed Lucy, and said
to me: “Well, here you are back safe, you bad
young man. You’ve given us a rare fright, I can
tell you”—and that was all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same evening, when the ladies were safely
abed, I had a long talk with Mr. Thatcher in
the bar parlor. After dear Lucy’s escapade, we
decided we might as well be married at once,
without waiting for Easter; and that, with the
help of a license, the following Thursday, February
6th, would be none too soon. For myself,
apart from other considerations, I thought it
clearly wisest to get married and clear out of the
country, on a lengthy wedding-tour, as quick as
we could; so that, in case of search being made
for me, as the head and guiding spirit of the
raid, I might, for some few months at any rate,
be <span class='it'>non inventus</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next, I delicately approached the subject of
the repurchase of Wharton Park. I told Mr.
Thatcher we had been extraordinarily lucky at
Monte Carlo, and that, by a combination of rare
circumstances, I was the richer by £30,000 than
when I started. He was shrewd enough to listen
in silence and ask no sort of question as to what
particular system I had pursued to enable me to
return with so large a sum. In fact, I scarcely
gave him time to ask questions, I was so rapid,
hurrying forward only to the main point, whether
Crage’s offer were still open and we should
still be able to get the old wretch out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told me that since Crage’s last visit and
offer to marry Lucy he had seen nothing of him,
and, so far as he knew, the place was still to be
had. We could, if I liked, go up to the house
in a day or two and make inquiries cautiously, or
write Crage a letter making him a formal proposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which I replied that, knowing something
of human nature, I judged it best, when we made
our offer, to be prepared with the actual sum in
notes and gold to make it good; for, with a
man like Crage, combined of malice and craft,
he would most likely try to bluff and raise us unless
he saw the very gold and notes before him,
beyond which, not having any more to offer, we
were not prepared to go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very true,” said Thatcher. “There’s nothing
like the ready to tempt a man, as I know very
well. Why, when I was in business—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then all we can do,” I continued, cutting
him short, “is to wait in patience till the
boodle—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The what?” said Thatcher, taking the pipe
out of his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an American term—the money we have
won, arrives. It’s coming in the yacht, and should
be here in a day or two now. Then we’ll go up
with it to the house, in a bag, and spread it out
on the table—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I shall be back in Wharton Park again!”
cried Thatcher. “Gracious powers! Who would
have thought it possible? And, of course, it will
be settled on Lucy. Me for life, and then Lucy.
How delighted my poor old mother will be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” I said, “and that your name may be
perpetuated, I will add it to my own. Father-in-law,
here’s health and prosperity to those two
fine old English families, the Thatcher-Blackers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So there was nothing we could do but wait in
patience for the arrival of the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>. It
was tedious, anxious work, for though I never
doubted all would be well, yet Bailey Thompson’s
portentous silence somewhat alarmed me;
and as the days passed, and neither he nor the
yacht gave any sign of their existence, my nerves
began to get unstrung, and I grew worn and irritable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately, as often happens in the early
days of February, the weather was beautifully
fine; so fine that the more flatulent class of
newspapers were full of letters from country
correspondents, who were finding hedge-sparrows’
eggs and raspberries in their gardens, and
the usual Lincolnshire parson broke into jubilant
twitterings over his dish of green pease.
Otherwise, I don’t think I really could have
borne it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, late on the Tuesday evening, came a
telegram from Brentin at Southampton—“<span class='it'>Safe,
will arrive to-morrow</span>”—and I began to breathe
a little easier. But not a word of any sort from
Bailey Thompson, neither a reproach nor a
threat; till I felt like that Damocles of Syracuse
who, though seated on a throne, was yet
immediately under a faintly suspended sword.
For here was I, on a throne, indeed—the throne
of dear Lucy’s pure and constant affection—and
yet!—at any moment!—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dramatically enough, the sword fell on my very
wedding morning—on its flat side, happily—giving
me a shock, but no cut of any sort, as I am
now briefly going to tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning came another telegram from
Brentin in London, to say he would arrive at six
and beg he might be met. All was well, he wired,
adding “<span class='it'>Any news Thompson?</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wired back to the “Victoria” there was none:
“<span class='it'>bring boodle with you</span>;” and then I went off and
found Thatcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For always I had had the fancy to pay old
Crage out of the place and be married on the
same day, and here was now my chance. We
were to be married in Nesshaven Church, in the
grounds of Wharton Park, at twelve; what was
to prevent us, I said to Thatcher, from walking
on up to the house first with £30,000, completing
the purchase, and hasting to the wedding afterwards?
Thence back to “The French Horn”
for a light lunch, afterwards catch the half-past-two
train for Liverpool Street, and so to Folkestone
in the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was nothing to prevent it, said Thatcher,
who for the last two days had gone about in a
triumphant, bulging white waistcoat; only it
would require rather delicate handling, all to be
done successfully. Crage should be prepared,
for instance, he thought; for, notwithstanding
the sight of the money, the sight of dear Lucy
in her happy wedding radiance might turn him
sour, and he might after all refuse to complete.
What was to prevent one of us, he said—meaning,
of course, me—going up to the house and
sounding the old man first? Then we should
know exactly how we stood, and what chance
there was of our money being accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, for the last week nothing had been seen
of the old man, and rumors had reached us, chiefly
through the gardener, he was very ill. He
hadn’t been to church for more than a month,
and at church he had always been a very regular
attendant; not so much because he had any real
religion in him as that he might aggravate the
parson by catching him up loudly in the responses,
and barking his way harshly through
the hymns a good half-line behind the rest of
the congregation. Indeed, the chief attraction,
I fear, at Nesshaven Church was old Crage and
his nauseous eccentricities, and people who had
heard how he had once lighted up his pipe during
the sermon and sat there sucking at it in the
Wharton pew, came from miles round in the hope
he would enliven the discourse by doing it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor had he been seen about the grounds, nor
stumping down to the inn, as he mostly did once
a week to insult the inmates; in short, the end
that comes to us all—good, bad, and indifferent—was
clearly coming now to him, and if business
were ever to be done, it must be done speedily
and at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So, before Brentin came, early on the Wednesday
afternoon, I trudged alone up to the house.
There wasn’t a sign of life in it, and when I rang
at the hall door I heard the heavy bell clanging
away down the empty passages and cold servants’
quarters as in the depths of an Egyptian tomb.
I rang and rang, until at last I heard shuffling
footsteps approach. From the other side of the
door came stertorous breathing and wheezing,
and the undoing of a chain; then a burglar’s bell
was taken off and fell with a jangle on the stone
floor inside, and at last the door was pulled ajar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor old Crage! He looked out at me with
his wicked, frightened old face, pinched, haggard,
unshaven, dirty; terror-struck, as though
he feared, I were Death himself who had been
knocking at the door. He was in his shirt and
trousers and a frowzy old dressing-gown, and his
bare, bony feet were thrust in worn leather slippers.
As he breathed his throat rattled dismally,
and his long hand, with the thick, muddy veins,
shook so he couldn’t fold the dressing-gown
round his gaunt, corded, bare throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, young cockney!” he croaked; “what’s
to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are you, Mr. Crage?” I asked, shocked
at the old man’s fallen, forlorn look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very bad!” he whispered, his rheumy eyes
blinking with watery self-pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anybody looking after you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—thieves! all thieves!—don’t want
’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he made as if he would shut the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came up to see you on business,” I said;
“about selling the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No business to-day,” he croaked. “Too ill.
Come to-morrow—any time. Come to-morrow.”
And with that he shut the door in my face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I heard him shuffling away across the hall, kicking
the fallen bell with a tinkle along the floor,
and then, as I turned to go, I heard him fall and
groan. I ran in hastily, and with great difficulty
managed to get him on his feet again. He
stood there for some few minutes, clutching me
and rattling his throat; then, hanging on my
arm, dragging me along with him, he paddled off
down a short dark passage towards a half-open
door, pushed it wide, and pulled me after him
into the great empty drawing-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blinds were down, and the fading February
sun gleamed in on the bare worn carpet.
In front of the fine fireplace, with a little dying
wood-fire in it, stood an arm-chair, with a small
table beside it. A candle and snuffers were on
it, and a plate of stale bread-and-butter. On the
high mantel-piece was a medicine bottle, full and
corked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sank back into his chair, and lay there,
breathing heavily, with his eyes closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But is there nobody looking after you?” I
asked, and he made some twitching movement
with his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just at that moment in flounced the gardener’s
wife, drying her hands on her apron. She was
a big, handsome, shameless-looking creature,
with a naming eye and a hard, high color on her
stiff cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now you’ve been moving yourself about
again!” she cried, bending over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crage opened his eyes and looked up at her
maliciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He came up on business,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a pretty man to do business, ain’t
you?” she sneered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not to-day,” he mocked. “Too ill. All
right to-morrow. Tell the genelman to come
to-morrow, early. Quite well to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I turned to go, and Crage, raising himself in
his chair, rasped out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring the money with you, young cockney,
or no business. Mind that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman followed me to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he got a doctor?” I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doctor Hall came once,” she said, “but he
won’t do anything he tells him. He won’t take
his medicine and he won’t go to bed. He says
he’ll die if he goes to bed. He sleeps all night
in that arm-chair in the drawing-room. If he
don’t die soon, I shall; I know that very well.
If you’ve got any business to do with him, you’d
better come early in the morning. He can’t last
much longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with that she closed the door on me, and
I heard her putting up the chain again and the
burglar’s bell as I went away down the weedy
gravel path.</p>

<div class='summary'>
ARRIVAL OF BRENTIN—MY WEDDING-DAY—WE GO TO
WHARTON—BAILEY THOMPSON AND COCHEFORT FOLLOW
US—WE FINALLY DEFEAT THEM BOTH
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Brentin</span> was in “The French Horn” by a
quarter to seven, and, rather to my surprise, he
came alone. I thought Hines or Masters would
surely have come with him; but no, he said, except
for Forsyth, they had all parted company at
Southampton. Masters and Miss Rybot had
gone to Sea View, where they were to be married
almost immediately, and Hines had gone off to
stay with a married sister at Bournemouth.
Forsyth alone had travelled up to town with him,
and then gone on straight to Colchester to take
up his neglected regimental duties. So I wrote
out a telegram to be sent first thing in the morning,
begging him to come over and be my best
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the boodle? Brentin winked and, with
his hands on his knees, began to laugh, like the
priest in the <span class='it'>Bonne Histoire</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of it has melted, sir,” he joyously
cried. “Your friend Hines has got his, and
Mr. Parsons, by this time, is toying with ay registered
letter way up in Southport. I have handsomely
recompensed Captain Evans and the
crew; they have, no doubt, been tanking-up and
painting Portsmouth red all the time. I have
reimbursed myself for the yacht and other trifles,
and there now remains the £30,000 for your
young lady’s ancestral home, and some £20,000
for the hospitals and so on. To-morrow, sir, we
will draw up a list of the most deserving of
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the money with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said; it was all safe in what he
called his grip, or hand-bag, and quite at my
service. I told him of my desire to complete the
purchase immediately before the marriage was
solemnized, and then we fell to talking of Bailey
Thompson and his strange silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the man is piqued, sir,” said Brentin;
“that’s what he is, piqued. Beyond saying
that, I do not propose to give him ay second
thought. He is mad piqued, and that’s all there
is to it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I tried to feel completely at my ease, and
managed to spend a very happy evening in the
bar parlor, Lucy playing to us and Brentin occasionally
bursting into raucous song. Now, when
I think of him, I like best to remember him as
he was that evening, forgetting his harder, commoner
side, when he so outrageously proposed to
desert poor Teddy; even refusing (as I forgot at
the time to mention) to allow the cannon to be
brought into play for his rescue by shelling the
rooms. He was infinitely gay and amusing, only
finishing up the evening, after dear Lucy’s retirement,
with a long and violent dispute with
Mr. Thatcher on the vague subject of the immortality
of the soul. Thatcher believed he had
a soul and would live forever, in another, happier
sphere; Brentin denied it, could see no sign of
Thatcher’s soul anywhere; so I left them trying
to shout each other down, both speaking at
once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I retired to rest with many solemn, touching
thoughts. The last night of bachelorhood gives
rise to at least as much deep reflection as that of
the young maiden’s; more, in fact, so far as the
bachelor himself is concerned. I thought over
it all so long and deeply I at last got confused,
and when I woke, the bright February sun was
streaming in on my best clothes and the bells
from Nesshaven Church were ringing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the morning those bells rang out their happy,
irregular peal.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='poetry-container' style=''><div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“The village church beneath the trees,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Where first our marriage vows were given,</p>
<p class='line0'>With merry peal shall swell the breeze,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And point with slender spire to heaven!”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Only, to be exact, Nesshaven Church has no
spire, but a sunk, old, bird-haunted, ivy-clad
tower.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Thatcher’s idea to set the bells going
early and keep them at it all day; you see, they
rang not only for the marriage of his only child,
but for his return to their ancestral home; and,
when they showed any sign of flagging, Thatcher
listened with a pained expression, and cried,
“Why, surely they’re not going to stop yet!
Run, Bobby, or Harriet, or George, my man!”—or
whoever happened to be handy—“and tell
’em to keep ’em going, and give ’em this from
me. Here, Vincent, my boy, have you got half-a-crown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By ten o’clock we were all dressed and ready,
waiting only for Forsyth. Soon after ten he
came, and the procession started. It was a lovely
day again, mild and sunny, and, in true country-wedding
fashion, we all set out to walk.
Lucy, looking perfectly sweet in gray, was on her
father’s arm, and the old lady, in black silk, on
mine; while Brentin, carrying his grip, with the
boodle in it, and that good little chap, Forsyth,
brought up the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady, who within the last three months
seemed to me to have failed a good deal, mentally,
at any rate, stepped out right well, hanging
lightly on my arm. At first she thought we
were going straight to the church, and couldn’t
understand why we left it on our right and went
on up to the big house. Then she seemed to
think it quite natural, and that the place was hers
again, and began talking of her early days, when
first she was married and came to Wharton as a
bride. Once or twice, indeed, she called me
“Francis,” her husband’s name, who died in
1850, and drew my attention to the scandalous,
weedy state of the walks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this is what we pay good wages for!”
she cried. “These men must be spoken to about
it, my dear, immediately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gardener’s wife, who opened for us the
hall door, was astonished at our numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, what a crowd of you!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old lady passed her haughtily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Tom!” she cried to Mr. Thatcher.
“We’ll go up-stairs and have tea in <span class='it'>my</span> room.
Come, Lucy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And up-stairs, up the bare stone staircase, they
went, for, as I whispered to Thatcher, it was just
as well the ladies should be out of the way while
we did our business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the great empty drawing-room we found old
Crage ready waiting for us. He had dressed
himself up in rusty attorney black for the occasion,
and the plain kitchen-table was neatly
spread with bundles of documents, title-deeds,
and so forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the woman showed us in, she told me he
had been up all night rummaging in his old tin
boxes, talking and mumbling to himself. Now
he seemed quite spry and well again. I could
scarcely believe, as he sat there alert and attentive,
he was the same stricken, shambling old
hunks I had seen the previous afternoon, dragging
himself about, senile and dying. Such is
the power of the will and the business instinct,
prolonged even to the verge of the grave!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brentin, who, as usual, took everything into
his own hands, adopted the simplest method of
dealing with him. Crage received us in complete
silence, and no one spoke a word, while Brentin
opened his grip and took out the notes and
two or three little bags of gold. The gold he
emptied into heaps and piled them round the
notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, “Thirty thousand pounds,” he said,
with a smile—“thirty thousand pounds! Is it
a deal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crage sat bolt upright, with his hand curved
over his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the entire property?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the entire property. Is it a deal?
Thirty thousand pounds, neither less nor more.”
And he emptied the grip and shook it, to show
that not a penny more remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s worth more in the open market,” said
Crage, cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then take it to the open market. We have
no time to haggle. My client is on his way to
be married. Good-day.” And with that he
began to scrape the notes and gold together
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold hard!” cried Crage. “Don’t hurry an
old man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll give the old man three minutes,” said
Brentin, coolly pulling out his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were all three of us grouped round the
table, watching Crage, with our backs to the
door. The woman stood at his elbow, and we
could, in the complete silence, hear the heavy,
swinging tick-tick of Brentin’s large old-fashioned
watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half time!” cried Brentin, when suddenly
we heard steps outside in the hall. I had just
time to recognize Bailey Thompson’s even, divisional
tread, when he pushed the door open
and stepped in. He was dressed as usual, and
behind him came a gentleman in a tight black
frock-coat, an evident Frenchman, thin, dark,
and wiry, with a withered face, like a preserved
Bordeaux plum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment, if—you—please, gentlemen!”
cried Bailey Thompson, as he stepped up to the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My heart gave a bound, and Forsyth started
and said, “Ho!” but the unabashed Brentin
merely politely replied, “One moment to <span class='it'>you</span>,
sir. We will attend to you directly.—Time’s up,
Mr. Crage! is it or is it not a deal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bailey Thompson laughed. “Cool as ever,
Mr. Brentin, I see,” he said. “But don’t you
think this amusing farce of yours has gone on
long enough? It has been successful so far, as
I always thought it would be!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re mighty good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have no desire to be unduly hard on
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mighty particular good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Casino authorities are, on the whole,
willing to regard you as eccentric English gentlemen
of position, who have played a very cruel
practical joke on them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is so. This is their representative,
Mossieu Cochefort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Enchantay!</span>” cried Brentin, with a bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is charged to say that, on the due return
of the money you have sto—ahem!—carried off,
and an undertaking from you in writing that
you none of you ever visit the place again, on
any pretence, they are willing to forego criminal
proceedings, and no further questions will be
asked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come off it!” cried Brentin, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Otherwise,” continued Bailey Thompson,
with great gravity, “I must ask you, Mr. Blacker,
and Mr. Forsyth here, to follow me to the cab in
waiting at the door, and return with us to London
as our prisoners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short, sir,” said Brentin, swelling with
indignant importance, “you invite <span class='it'>us</span>, eccentric
gentlemen of recognized position, to compound
a felony!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thompson shrugged his shoulders, and Mossieu
Cochefort looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be ashamed of yourself, sir!” Brentin cried,
his voice ringing scornfully through the empty
room. “Be ashamed of yourselves, you and
Mossieu Cochefort, and give over talking through
your hat! Mr. Crage, if you will write out a
formal receipt we will look upon the affair as
settled. The formal transfer can be effected
later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aye, aye!” mumbled Crage, and, with his
eyes on the money, began fumbling in the inside
pocket of his rusty black coat for the receipt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen!” cried Thompson, with affected
earnestness, “I warn you! I very solemnly warn
you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, come off it, Mr. Bailey Thompson, sir!”
was Brentin’s emphatic and withering reply;
“come off it, and shut your head. We have long
had enough of you and your gas. For my part,
my earnest advice to you and Mossieu Cochefort
is that you kiss yourselves good-bye and go your
several ways. And tell your amazing Casino
Company from us that the only undertaking we
will give them is not to come and do it again in
the fall. To repeat a success is always dangerous;
and next time, no doubt, you will all be
better prepared.—Now, Mr. Crage, the receipt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Qu’est ce qu’il a dit?</span>” asked the puzzled
Frenchman, as Thompson, fuming and fretting,
dragged him off to the window to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime old Crage had produced his receipt,
already written and signed, and, handing it over,
with trembling, eager fingers was beginning to
count the notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten fifties—ten thousands—ten twenties,”
he was mumbling, “nice clean notes—beautiful
crisp notes—he won’t get ’em back from me,
if that’s what he’s after! No, no, not from
Crage. Crage wasn’t in Clement’s Inn for forty
years for nothing. Ten more fifties!—” So he
went on mumbling to himself, and stuffing the
notes away in a broken old pocket-book, while
Brentin handed me over the receipt, and snapped
his grip with a click.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” he whispered. “We’ve bluffed
’em. Keep cool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hadn’t you better let me keep ’em for you!”
whined the woman, bending over Crage’s chair.
“You’ll only lose ’em. Give ’em me to take
care of for you, there’s a dearie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which pathetic appeal the old man paid no
sort of heed, but pushed the pocket-book into
his inside breast-pocket, with many senile signs
of satisfaction and joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now!” cried Brentin, in imperturbable
high spirits, “the wedding-procession will reform,
and proceed to the church for the tying
of the sacred knot. Mr. Bailey Thompson—Mossieu
Cochefort—we shall be glad if you will
join us, and afterwards, at ‘The French Horn,’
to a slight but high-toned repast. Good-day,
Mr. Crage; take care of yourself and your
money. Let us hope that when the robins nest
they will find you in your usual robust health.
Mossieu Cochefort—Mr. Bailey Thompson—if
you will kindly follow us—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a sudden access of fury seemed to have
seized the usually calm little detective; he was
stamping his feet, waving his arms, almost foaming
at the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In execrable French, Stratford-atte-Bow-Street
French, he began to swear aloud he would have
nothing more to do with it, that he had done his
best, that he had never yet had dealings with
the French police but they hadn’t muddled it;
for his part, his work was finished, and he was
going home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here they are!” he cried, “three of them,
all ready for you. Will you have them, or won’t
you? <span class='it'>Les voilar! Nong? Vous ne les voulay
pas?</span> Then if you don’t want them, why the ——”
(dreadful bad word!) “did you bring me
off down here?” he yelled, breaking into profane
English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais, voyons! voyons!</span>” murmured the startled
and conciliatory Cochefort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn your <span class='it'>voyons</span>!” Bailey Thompson
screamed. “If you don’t want them, and won’t
take them, do the rest of it yourself, the best
way you can. I wash my hands of it. Good-day,
gentlemen, and thank your lucky stars for
the imbecility of the French police!” and with
that he rushed to the door, through the hall,
and out into his cab. As he pulled the hall
door open I heard the wedding-bells come surging
in with a new burst of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais, mon ami!</span>” cried Cochefort, as Thompson
tore himself away, “<span class='it'>ne me laissez pas comme
ça!</span>” and with much gesticulation prepared to
follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Brentin sagely stopped him. “<span class='it'>Restay,
Mossieu Cochefort!</span>” he said, graciously; “<span class='it'>Restay
avec nous. Tout va biang. Restay!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais, quel cochon!</span>” cried the angry Cochefort,
stretching out his black kid hands, and
shaking them in Bailey Thompson’s direction.
“<span class='it'>Ma parole d’honneur! a t’on jamais vu un
pareil sacré cochon!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est vrai!</span>” said Brentin. “<span class='it'>Mais il est
toujours comme ça. Vous savvy, il n’est pas
gentilhomme. Nous sommes tous gentilhommes.
Nous vous garderong et vous traiterong tray biang.
Restay!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Mossieu Cochefort allowed himself to be
comforted, and restay’d. We took him with us
to the church, and did him right well at lunch,
and then, so forlorn and downcast the poor
creature seemed, Lucy and I carried him off
with us up to town, if only out of kindness, to
put him on his way back to Monaco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the way up in the train he confessed to
me his only instructions had been to try and get
the money back, and that if he couldn’t manage
that, or part of it, he was directed not to think
of embarrassing the authorities by taking us all
in charge. I could conceive, he said, that the
authorities didn’t want to be made the laughing-stock
of Europe by having to try us, nor to add
to their already heavy expenses by keeping us in
prison—nearly all quite young men—for the
term of our natural lives. He hadn’t been able
fully to explain all this to Bailey Thompson: the
man was such a lunatic, he said, and so obstinate:
and besides, from the moment of his
arrival Bailey Thompson had ridden the high
horse over him, and proudly declaring he didn’t
require to be taught his duties by a foreigner,
had immediately carried him off down to Nesshaven,
scarcely allowing him once to open his
mouth all the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Liverpool Street he seemed more lost, poor
wretch, than ever. He knew no single word of
English, and looked at us so pathetically, as we
stood on the platform together, our soft hearts
were touched. So we made up our minds to
carry him along with us to Folkestone, dine him
at the “Pavilion,” and afterwards see him safe
on board the night-boat for Boulogne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was droll, all the same, this carrying a French
detective about with us on our wedding-day; but
the man was so truly grateful I have never regretted
it. We gave him a good dinner at the
hotel, and at ten o’clock walked him out on
to the pier for his boat. He made me a little
speech at parting, declaring I had treated him
“<span class='it'>en vrai camarade</span>,” and that if ever I wanted
to come to Monte Carlo again I was to let him
know and he would see I came to no harm. To
Lucy he presented all his compliments and felicitations
on securing the affection of “<span class='it'>un si
galant homme!</span>” and then, with a twenty-pound
note I slipped into his hand at parting, bowed
himself away, and was soon lost to sight in the
purlieus of the second cabin, whither he went
prepared to be dreadfully sick, smooth and calm
as the night was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Lucy and I strolled back to the hotel, arm-in-arm,
we both were silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, just as we got back and heard the
steamer’s final clanging bell and despairing whistle,
“I can’t make out, really, whether you’ve
all done right or wrong,” she whispered, softly;
“but this I know, dearest, you have been most
extraordinarily lucky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which simple little speech I merely pressed
her arm, by way of showing how thoroughly I
agreed with her.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id='p243'>CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>This</span> is the true account of our raiding the
tables at Monte Carlo, done the best way I could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest, I may just mention poor old Crage
died before the end of the month, and by Easter
Mr. Thatcher and his mother were safely installed
in Wharton Park. Arthur Masters was married
to Miss Rybot in April, Forsyth is to do the same
to a widow (so he says) in September, Bob Hines
is very flourishing with his new gymnasium and
swimming-bath—just about finished now, as I
write, at the end of June—and Parsons is, I believe,
at Southport, parading Lord Street as usual
in breeches and gaiters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Brentin, I never saw him again, for by
the time Lucy and I had returned from our
honeymoon he was back in New York. But I
heard from him the other day—a long, rambling
letter, in which he told me he had sold the <span class='it'>Amaranth</span>
to Van Ginkel, for his wife the Princess
Danleno, whom he had remarried, and with
whom, on separate vessels, he was sailing about
the Greek Archipelago—probably in belated
search for Bailey Thompson. He concluded
by begging me to think of something “snappy”
we could do together in the fall, ending finally
by writing: “What’s the matter with our going
to Egypt and turning the Nile into the Red Sea?
A communicative stranger, an Englishman, by his
accent, assures me there is just one place where
it can be done. Think it over, sonny, and if you
decide to do it, count on me. Sincerely, <span class='sc'>Julius
C. Brentin</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would write more, only Lucy is calling to me
from the hay-field, the other side of the ha-ha of
Wharton, where I have come to finish this work
in retirement.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
